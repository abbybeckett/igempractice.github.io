          Our project began with research on biomarkers and their diagnostic assays. Initially, microfluidics seemed to be a promising approach to streamlining the diagnostic process. However, as we progressed, it became evident that there was also a pressing need for a hardware solution capable of fluorescence detection and quantification. We recognized the need to keep it an accessible, affordable and practical device for widespread use, in comparison to traditional fluorimeters. In an effort to provide a more reliable and objective diagnostic tool, we have attempted to develop a novel FRET-based microfluidic device to diagnose clinical depression. 
<br><br>Our main goal is to introduce an affordable and user-friendly biomarker-based diagnostic tool for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). To achieve this, we’ve designed a simple and accessible system. It consists of a microfluidic chip that is inserted into the slot of a 3D printed box equipped with an LCD screen, an Arduino UNO setup, and the necessary accessories.
<br><br>Here’s how it works: when the microfluidic chip is inserted into the device, the internal blue LED excites the sample, and the fluorescence emitted is detected by a photodarlington sensor. The intensity of fluorescence measured is then converted into the biomarker concentration levels and displayed on the LCD screen,with all data readings being managed by the Arduino UNO microcontroller. This prototype is designed to show the functionality of the system, using the most basic components and with the least complexities.

       <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p align="justify">
            Being a heterogeneous disorder, MDD is influenced by a variety of factors. Therefore, a single biomarker may not be the only factor causing MDD or even provide us with an accurate indication of whether or not a person has MDD. So, to bring high sensitivity and reliability to MDD diagnosis, our microfluidic chip employs 5 different putative biomarkers. Thus, to understand the significance and relevance of our biomarkers to MDD and its correlation with other diseases and validate our choice, we use the Bayesian network for biomarker analysis.

              <h1>Coming up with a Solution</h1>
              <p>
                What makes a good therapeutic? - is a question that we asked ourselves
                and our stakeholders over the course of our project. After talking to
                our stakeholders, we identified the hallmarks of a good therapeutic.
              </p>
              <h2>An ideal therapeutic for Dengue should:</h2>
              <br/>
              <div class="pd-img-container"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4429/wiki/ihp/ihp/human-prac/plan-2-page-0001.jpg"/> 
            </div>
               <br/>
              
              <p>
                Incorporating these properties into our solution would enable it to be a viable option for the treatment of Dengue.<br/>
                Over the course of our project, <b>we’ve done our best to meet the above requirements</b> and have constantly edited our project to fit
                into our vision of an ideal therapeutic.<br/>
                However, we have been constrained by the nature of our solution in certain areas like having a low cost of production. Using a bacterial
                system for the production of our antibodies is probably more expensive than the traditional method of immunizing animals and extracting
                antibodies from them. However, we <b>prioritised using a safe, ethical and modular method</b> over having a low cost of production. Even
                so, our
                current method of using a bacterial chassis is relatively cheaper and easier than using eukaryotic cells, as outlined in detail below.
                <br/>
                Additionally, we have also prioritised having a therapeutic that causes minimal immunogenic response over a minimally invasive mode of
                drug delivery as outlined in detail below. 
        
        
              </p>
              <p>
                When we first sat down to think of a solution, an obvious direction for us was to find a molecule that would render the virus inactive
                but not bind with the Fc receptors. After a literature study, we hit upon the <b>avian class of antibodies - IgY</b>, which checked all
                of our requirements. Being a non-mammalian antibody, it is incompatible with the mammalian Fc receptor and they could be engineered to
                bind and neutralize dengue virus or any virus with multiple virulent serotypes, for that matter, as long as we had the sequence.<br/>
                <br/>
        
        
               We faced our first roadblock with acquiring the sequence and realized that the 3D structure of IgY had not yet been publicly resolved.
               With the help of <b>Dr David Bradley and Juho Choi, IgY researchers</b>, who sent us the sequence of the constant region, we put together
               the construct of an IgY-IgG hybrid with the constant region of IgY and the variable region of IgG and even resolved a 3D image of it. As a
               placeholder, our hybrid antibody was targeting the Maltose Binding Protein. We were extremely lucky to have had in-depth discussions with
               <b>Dr Alexander I Taylor, who had worked extensively with IgYs before and our secondary PI Dr Mehmet Berkmen, a bacterial geneticist from
                NEB</b>, regarding the properties of IgY. Dr Taylor advised against using an IV mode of drug delivery and warned us about the <b>possible
                immunogenic response</b> that could result from exposing our body to avian antibodies. We also had multiple discussions with <b>Dr
                Satyajit Rath and Dr Vineeta Bal, who are both immunologists at our institution</b>, regarding the possible immune response of our body
                against
                IgY and what we could do to circumvent it. While the prospect of <b>deimmunisation by removing the T-cell epitopes</b> on our construct
                was
                considered, the risk of inadvertently destabilizing the structure and thereby compromising the efficacy of our antibody was too much. Dr
                Rath also told us that our IgY-IgG construct was simply a <b>very high-tech solution to a very low-tech industry</b>. We also learnt from
                <b>Dr Supriya Kashikar, the founder of Genext Genomics</b>, who told us that the half-life of IgYs in the body would be low since it
                cannot bind to the FcRn receptor in our body and therefore cannot be recycled. Further, <b>Dr Gavin Screaton, an Immunologist at the
                University of Oxford</b>, advised us <b>not to continue with IgY</b> and instead opt for an alternative.<br/>
                <br/>
        
                We wanted our drug to offer a solution to ADE, to effectively neutralise the disease, for the virus-antibody complex to be cycled out of
                our body with a minimal immune reaction from our body, and for the dosage levels to be non-toxic. Since our solution did not check all of
                these boxes, we decided to shift away from it. This came as a setback for us, but we were determined to have a realistic, simple, and
                effective solution for ADE and a good drug. Following advice given by Dr Screaton and Dr Rath, we looked into the functionality of Fc
                mutated IgGs and aglycosylated IgGs - it had all the advantages of using IgY with the added benefit of not causing an immunogenic
                response. However, circling back to Dr Kashikar’s warning and our subsequent literature review<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2018.01.006"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, Fc mutated antibodies would still have
                meant that its half-life in our body would be low and the cost of use high.<br/>
                <br/>
                <b>In a bid to improve affordability and to simplify our solution further, we landed on single chain fragment variable (scFv).</b>
                <br/>
                <br/> 
                ScFvs are <b>small</b> and have no constant regions (and thereby no effector functions). Their size makes them <b>cost effective and
                efficient</b>. However their half-life in the human body is quite low. To solve this problem, we decided to insert a peptide extension to
                the scFv that would increase its half-life by binding to the FcRn receptor. We decided to call this structure <b>NeoFvs</b>. We were very
                fortunate in successfully reaching out to <b>Dr Shannon Sirk and Mr Vince Kelly, who have both worked extensively with scFvs before</b>,
                to gain their inputs on working with scFvs with the FcRn binding peptide for dengue. Mr Kelly informed us that they were unable to
                generate all the variants with the binding peptide in different regions of the scFv due to time constraints and resources and asked us to
                look into it. We tried to surpass this by using HADDOCK simulations. He even <b>suggested a possible future implementation</b> to
                engineer bacteria and release them into the gut such that they produce these NeoFvs when needed. He commended us for taking forward their
                initial project of using these scFvs for breast cancer into viruses, calling it a true test of modularity.

               When we looked into the existing production methods for IgY, we found that the popular method was to <b>extract it from purified egg yolk
               by infecting chickens with the virus</b>. We felt that this method was <b>unethical</b>. Moreover, it had issues with
               batch standardisation and sustained production. It also generated polyclonal antibodies, which increase chances of cross-reactivity,
               leading to false positives and non-specific interactions with the antigen, which could be non-neutralising. <br/>
               <br/>
              We began looking for an alternative which ticked off our expectations for a good chassis and locked onto SHuffle. The SHuffle B strain
              derived from the E. coli B strain was a fit for most of our requirements. We reached out to <b>Dr Mehmet Berkmen, who works at New England
              Biolabs (NEB)</b> and was instrumental in the creation and development of the SHuffle strain of bacteria and was the first to produce
              full-length IgG antibodies with it. What started out as a zoom meeting ended up being a lengthy and fruitful relationship with him agreeing
              to be our secondary PI. He was delighted at the prospect of mentoring us and was incredibly helpful in ironing out the myriad questions we
              had regarding the culturing of SHuffle, production conditions and optimization.<br/>
              <br/>
        
        
              <b>Dr Raghavan Varadarajan, a biophysicist from IISc, Bangalore</b>, urged us to look into alternative production methods like standardized
              CHO cell lines and yeast systems when presented with our project. Following his advice, we did a thorough literature search and found that
              while CHO cells produce accurate complex proteins with high yields, they are expensive to culture and are slow growing (both points
              independently reiterated by <b>Dr Mugdha Gadgil, a CHO cell expert at NCL, Pune</b>, they can also have unwanted post-translational
              modifications like glycosylation.<br/> 
              Furthermore, <b>Dr Vinod Jyothikumar, a consultant for operational risk management at DSS+</b>, during a question and answer
              session after a webinar, pointed out that CHO cell lines do not retain stable protein expression over long-term culture and have a high
              cost of production. Additionally, <b>Dr Mayurika Lahiri, from our own institute</b>, told us that most animal house facilities don’t keep
              chickens
              since they are only used for producing IgY. This <b>traditional method of using chickens is removed from research and therefore our method
              of
              using a modular bacterial system could help promote further research into antibodies and antibody therapeutics</b>. 
              <br/>
              <br/> 
        
              A similar search regarding yeast systems and a conversation with <b>Dr Umesh Shaligram, director of R&D at the Serum Institute, India</b>
              (intoduced to us by the <b>GATES Foundation, India</b>), showed us that while it is widely used in recombinant protein production, they can
              mannosylate the antibody,  which could make it immunogenic. Bacteria lack the machinery for N-linked glycosylation, and cannot do the
              above. <b>Dr Ratnesh Jain, involved in recombinant protein production from ICT</b>, also advised against using eukaryotic cell lines since
              Dengue is primarily a tropical disease and requires the therapeutic to be affordable to all.

               Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family of viruses. It has 4 serotypes that can infect humans. India and Brazil have shown
               incidences of all four serotypes. <b>Choosing an appropriate epitope</b> that is equally conserved across all four serotypes, essential to
               the virulence of the virus and easily accessible was <b>crucial to overcome ADE</b> and neutralize the virus. After discussions with <b>Dr
               Nishad Matange, a bacterial geneticist at IISER Pune</b>, we looked into NS1 as a possible candidate based on his suggestions. NS1 protein
               is the only non-structural protein to be released extracellularly, which makes it an easy target for antibodies. Additionally, it is
               hypothesized to be crucial for the replication of the virus inside the host cells. 
        
              </p>
              <p>
                We then considered targeting the <b>Fusion Loop epitope</b>, which is essential for the virus to establish contact with the host cell and
                enter it. It is also highly conserved across serotypes. However, the FLE is partially hidden below EDI and ED-II and is exposed for a
                very short time, leading ot potential issues with accessibility. <b>Meetings with Dr Varadarajan Sundaramurthy and Dr Shashank Tripathi,
                both host-pathogen interaction experts from NCBS, Bangalore and IISc, Bangalore respectively</b>, yielded the same conclusion. They
                advised us to look into alternative epitopes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our conclusion was reached in a meeting with <b>Dr Vidya Mangala Prasad, a Dengue structural expert from IISc, Bangalore</b>. We
                presented the candidates we had in mind - NS1 protein, Fusion Loop epitope, EDI and ED-II to her and sought her inputs. <b>She suggested
                that we target the E dimer Epitope</b>, an epitope that is rarely targeted by the natural antibodies produced by our body, lessening
                competition with the therapeutic. It is also highly conserved across all four serotypes. Additionally, as EDE is present largely during
                the pre-mature stage, it will prevent binding and entry of the virus into the cell. She told us that the NS1 antibodies are only produced
                in greater concentrations after the viral load crosses a certain threshold and asked us to look into the C-10 class of antibodies, which
                had been isolated from human dengue patients. Following her suggestions, we did a thorough review of the literature on the E dimer
                Epitope and the stages of the viral cycle it existed in<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112304"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.3849"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. We did a sequence comparison that showed that EDE was conserved across
                serotypes. <b>We finally derived our scFv sequence from the C-10 antibody</b>. 
                <br />
                We looked into acquiring the E dimer epitope and considered obtaining the Envelope protein and dimerising it in the solution. However,
                <b>Dr Milind Gore, a highly-acclaimed immunologist and the former director of the National Institute of Virology (NIV)</b>, made us aware
                of the fact that the Envelope protein only dimerises and folds accurately in the presence of the pRM protein. This is the reason why
                vaccines that use just the E protein tend to fail to elicit neutralizing antibodies against EDE.<br/>
                Due to safety concerns, we could not use the entire virus and instead chose to work with a Dengue VLP whose cassette had been deposited
                by Dr Stephen Harrisson, Harvard, in Addgene. We then had <b>several discussions with Dr Rahul Roy who is a Dengue Virologist at IISc,
                Bangalore</b>, who was strongly supportive of going with the EDE and advised us against using a cocktail of antibodies, since that could
                lessen chances of neutralization. <b>He also offered to let us borrow his Dengue VLP construct and offered his help and lab space</b> to
                work
                on neutralization assays for our proof of concept. <b>Debayani Chakraborty</b>, from his lab, very graciously gave us her time and helped
                us perform our assay<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112304"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtm.2017.03.003"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.

          <b>Which sensor is the best?</b>
          <br><br>
          To determine which sensor would detect the lowest fluorescence, we conducted experimental trials with three different sensors: a photodiode, a phototransistor, and a Darlington transistor. We ultimately chose to use the Darlington transistor in our hardware design. 
          <br><br><b>Why not the other two?  </b>
          <br>
          Even though Photodiodes are very specific to the wavelength of our interest it can't detect the lowest intensity of them hence both photodiodes and phototransistors require an external amplifier to boost the signal, which increases the cost and complexity of the circuit.
          <br><br>
          To determine the sensitivity of the photodarlington sensor, we conducted a series of experiments:
          <br><br>
          Firstly,we measured the output voltage of the sensor at different light intensities from a green LED. We then plotted the output voltage versus the light intensity to create a calibration curve.
          <br><br>
          In the second, we moved on with a real lab sample, where we measured the output voltage of the sensor when exposed to different concentrations of PTE(phenyl tetraene) in DCM(dichloromethane). We also plotted the output voltage versus the PTE concentration to create a calibration curve.
          <br><br>
          Lastly, we immobilized the biomarker on an apta sensor and then measured the output voltage of the sensor when exposed to different concentrations of the Biomarker bound with the aptasensor. We again plotted the output voltage versus the biomarker concentration to create a calibration curve.

          Our current prototype uses basic components to showcase the concept, but we plan to use more efficient and affordable components in the future. 
          <br>
          We are considering upgrading to a microprocessor like the ESP32 series, which has more processing power and memory, built-in WiFi and Bluetooth modules, and can run Python and TensorFlow. This would allow us to add more photo sensors and modules, improve the results display system, and run machine learning algorithms on the device. 
          We will also design a well-organized circuit board layout to make the hardware small and compact. One possibility is to change the measurement from a voltage measurement to a capacitor discharge time measurement. This would allow us to measure even very low currents accurately.
          <br><br>
          Finally, Please refer our <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/iiser-tvm/implementation">PI page</a> for more information about the future of our hardware device.
