      <h4>Best Supporting Entrepreneurship</h4>
      <p>The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!</p>
      <p>To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize, please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the <a href="https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/judging-form">judging form</a>.</p>

    <h2>Patents and intellectual property</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.</p>
    <p>This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision.</p>

          Entrepreneurship isn't just about profit, it's also about making a positive impact in society. Since we started working on our project, our aim was to alleviate a major issue and stigma related to mental health pertaining in the current society. We tried to do so by making the diagnostic process easier through blood biomarkers. But as we started working on it, we realized that there is not enough biomarker data related to mental health diseases available, which was a major concern. Since we really wanted to take up this challenge, we slightly modified our goals. We ideated on developing a tool that can be used to build biomarker data in patients belonging to different genders and age groups. Once sufficient biomarker data would be obtained, our tool will be ready for use as a diagnostic product. 
          Seeing the immense potential of blood biomarkers in detecting several diseases in recent years, we are very excited to determine its correlation with mental disorders as well. This will be an extremely unique approach to diagnose mental health diseases since it will connect mental illness to tangible physiological changes in a person's body just like any other physical disease. Till now it was just an idea, but this is where we plan to take it ahead as a startup. We embarked on our entrepreneurial journey by attending the iGEM Startup Summer School which was a two day bootcamp giving us a glimpse into how startups work. Thereafter we also presented our project at the All India iGEM Meet and participated in the startup elevator pitch competition. Here we got a lot of valuable inputs and also the opportunity to interact with experienced innovators and entrepreneurs. To understand the workings of startup industries especially in the biotech field, we have currently enrolled and are undergoing a 9 week Bio-Entrepreneurship Program wherein we get to learn more about ideation, building prototypes, networking, market analysis, revenue generation etc. By the end of the program we'll be given a chance to pitch our project in front of renowned VCs and angel investors. Through conscious efforts like these we are confident to take our project further into the real world, potentially revolutionizing the mental health care industry.

        <h2 id = "subhead2"> Market Gap - Need for a Diagnostic Aid </h2>
        <a id="subhead2"></a>
        <p>

          Despite the prevalence of mental illness, progress in developing accurate diagnostics has been lagging. Several laboratory tests are available to diagnose MDD, but they are either extremely expensive or not viable due to the slow processing time of its result. Reviewing the current situation, the most commonly used methods are self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews, which are subjective and variable. There is need for a diagnostic tool that can generate objective results for MDD at a reasonable cost and aid clinicians in their diagnosis. This will eliminate subjectivity and falsification in self-reported data, significantly reduce misdiagnosis, and improve efficiency in identifying and treating clinical depression. Using blood biomarkers to diagnose MDD will be a paradigm shifting novel approach.

          The market for mental healthcare has undergone significant changes recently, with a focus on accessibility, digitalization, and reducing the stigma surrounding mental health disorders. The market is anticipated to grow further as awareness of mental health issues increases, with an emphasis on personalized care, early intervention, and holistic well-being.
However, ongoing research, validation, and ethical considerations will play a crucial role in shaping the future of this market.

        
        </p>
        <p>
          Major depressive disorder (MDD) currently affects at least 120 million people worldwide and, by 2030, will be the single highest contributor to the global disease burden.
A 2016 study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) found that one in seven people in India had a mental disorder. The most common was depression, which affected 45.7 million people. The Kerala state report of the National Mental Health Survey reported an overall prevalence of mental disorders of 11.36%. With our tool, we expect to reach out to the startling number of patients suffering from mental disorders in Kerala. Even though our product is directed to Clinicians, Researchers, and Pharma companies, a more significant number of people will be directly or indirectly positively impacted by our product. Hence all our stakeholders, including those suffering from mental health disorders and those at risk, are part of our extended service obtainable market.

          Our tool will act as an aid to the currently used methods for diagnosing MDD which includes self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews. Without an objective quantification method there are high chances of misdiagnosis, subjectivity and variation.[2]
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the existing commercially available approaches for diagnosing MDD are non-specific and unreliable[3], such as the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) that measures the extent to which cortisol secretion by the adrenal glands can be suppressed. It is pretty expensive and can't be a screening tool in itself because of its detection limited to cortisol levels only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spinal tapping is another technique but again is highly expensive and not the best preferred method because of its invasive and inaccessible nature.[4]

                <li>TRL 2: Technology concept formulated. Envisioned applications are speculative at this stage. [At this stage, we had enough analytical study to understand its sensitivity and specificity, so we used green LED to determine the same (give the link to testing and calibration part)
            
                  <li>TRL 3: Experimental proof of concept. Effective research and development initiated. [We used lab samples such as PTE in DCM to check the sensors' behavior, sensitivity, and specificity.] 
            
                    <li>TRL 4: Technology validated in lab. Technology validated through designed investigation.
             [We used our actual lab samples to validate the hardware; we compared the fluorolog results with the ones we got and showed similar trends in values. <Give hardware testing and calibration link here.>]
            </ul> </p>
          
          <p>      This is a significant milestone, demonstrating that the device can detect fluorescence from biological samples with high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory environment. Still, we are planning to extend it further in the future..
