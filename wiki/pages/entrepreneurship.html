      <h4>Best Supporting Entrepreneurship</h4>
      <p>The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!</p>
      <p>To compete for the Best Supporting Entrepreneurship prize, please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the <a href="https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/judging-form">judging form</a>.</p>

    <h2>Patents and intellectual property</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If your team is seriously considering commercializing and looking into building a company after the competition, you may want to look at how you are going to protect your work and secure investment. Investors will usually require some form of intellectual protection, so you may want to investigate how to apply for a patent or provisional patent in your country and region before disclosing your project at iGEM. Remember that you can only be evaluated in iGEM based on what you share on your wiki and at the Jamboree, so any work you don't present can't count towards your project.</p>
    <p>This is an area where we are different as we care about sharing, openness and contributing to the community and investors don't always agree with these values. It is up to you and your team to decide what to do. Remember that most universities have a commercialization department and that you can talk to them before coming to a decision.</p>

          Entrepreneurship isn't just about profit, it's also about making a positive impact in society. Since we started working on our project, our aim was to alleviate a major issue and stigma related to mental health pertaining in the current society. We tried to do so by making the diagnostic process easier through blood biomarkers. But as we started working on it, we realized that there is not enough biomarker data related to mental health diseases available, which was a major concern. Since we really wanted to take up this challenge, we slightly modified our goals. We ideated on developing a tool that can be used to build biomarker data in patients belonging to different genders and age groups. Once sufficient biomarker data would be obtained, our tool will be ready for use as a diagnostic product. 
          Seeing the immense potential of blood biomarkers in detecting several diseases in recent years, we are very excited to determine its correlation with mental disorders as well. This will be an extremely unique approach to diagnose mental health diseases since it will connect mental illness to tangible physiological changes in a person's body just like any other physical disease. Till now it was just an idea, but this is where we plan to take it ahead as a startup. We embarked on our entrepreneurial journey by attending the iGEM Startup Summer School which was a two day bootcamp giving us a glimpse into how startups work. Thereafter we also presented our project at the All India iGEM Meet and participated in the startup elevator pitch competition. Here we got a lot of valuable inputs and also the opportunity to interact with experienced innovators and entrepreneurs. To understand the workings of startup industries especially in the biotech field, we have currently enrolled and are undergoing a 9 week Bio-Entrepreneurship Program wherein we get to learn more about ideation, building prototypes, networking, market analysis, revenue generation etc. By the end of the program we'll be given a chance to pitch our project in front of renowned VCs and angel investors. Through conscious efforts like these we are confident to take our project further into the real world, potentially revolutionizing the mental health care industry.
