    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In addition to encouraging teams to work with DNA parts and build biological devices in the lab, iGEM also encourages other types of technical solutions for synthetic biology. This can include physical devices (hardware) related to robotic assembly, microfluidics, low-cost measurement devices, to name a few examples. There are many exciting opportunities for hardware innovation in synthetic biology.</p>

          In this page, we present how we envision OASYS in the real world - the proposed implementation, and most importantly, the proposed end users. 
          Along each step of the project, we consulted professionals across fields to ensure the conscientious and efficacious deployment of OASYS in practice. Keeping in line with this thought, we also discuss how the device can be curated to be used by different sectors under End User Analysis. 
          We also briefly touch upon the opportunity of commercialization of the project, more details of which can be found under the entrepreneurship section.

          As mentioned in the TRL analysis of our project, we are currently at TRL level - 
There were a lot of things we planned to do that we weren't able to do due to time, financial, and competition constraints. However, talking to relevant stakeholders like Anvaya Biotech and  Vidcare Innovations boosted our spirits to keep working on OASYS even after the iGEM competition since it would be a start of, or at least be a catalyst in the field of PoCT in mental healthcare. We realized that the preliminary design of the device proposed for the competition will have to undergo several optimizations to comply with the safety, qualitative and technical requirements.

          Developing a microfluidic biomarker-based diagnostic tool for mental health doesn’t come without a comprehensive set of challenges, spanning technical, administrative, and social domains.

          Technical Challenges:
          <br>
          a) Biomarkers and assays:
          Selecting and validating biomarkers is pivotal. 
          The validation process must extend beyond Cacasian populations to ensure broad applicability. 
          Issues like miRNA stability and assay standardization must be rigorously addressed to guarantee accurate results.
          <br> 
          b) Microfluidic chip:
          Optimizing mixing and sample dispersion on the microfluidic chip is crucial, emphasizing cost-effectiveness in mass production. Sustainable material use and waste disposal methods are also key considerations for environmental impact.
          <br>
          c) Fluorimeter:
          enhancing sensitivity and specificity of the fluorimeter, along with seamless integration between the chip and sensors, demands meticulous attention. Calibration procedures and quality control measures are essential for reliable results.
          <br>
          d) Data Collection:
          Integrating machine learning (ML) into data collection processes is imperative for scalability and efficiency, allowing for large-scale analysis of diverse datasets.
          <br>
          Administrative Challenges:
          
         <br>
          a) Regulations:
          Navigating regulatory requirements, including the establishment and continuous oversight of an ethics committee, certification acquisition, and quality control measures, is a persistent challenge.
          <br>
          b) User Training:
          Ensuring comprehensible instructions in multiple languages and thorough user training is vital. Ongoing user support from the development team is necessary for effective implementation.
          <br>
          c) Product:
          Conducting thorough market research to understand potential applications is essential. Tailoring marketing and pricing strategies, conducting risk assessments, and anticipating market demands are integral aspects of successful produtc management.
         <br>
          d) Scaling Business:
          Handling increased demand requires adept resource management and allocation, addressing supply chain logistics, organizing customer support, and establishing robust revenue streams.
          <br>
          e) IP and Patents:
          Developing a strategic approach for IP and patent filings, including trademark protection, due diligence, and licensing agreements, is critical for protecting intellectual property.
          <br>
          Social Challenges:
          <br>
          a) Data Management and Privacy:
          Safeguarding sensitive data involves stringent security measures, adherence to legal and ethical requirements, defining data retention periods, obtaining patient consent, and prioritizing patient privacy.
          <br>
          b) Education:
          Addressing the stigma associated with mental health requires a concerted effort in education and sensitivity training, both within the user community and the broader public.
          <br>
          
          In summary, overcoming the challenges in this ambitious project demands a synergistic approach, combining technical innovation, meticulous administrative planning, and a keen understanding of social dynamics. As the project progresses, continuous adaptation, collaboration, and a commitment to ethical and inclusive practices will be essential to realize the full potential of OASYS.
