We realized the importance of having a human-centric approach to developing our product design so that it can benefit people who need it the most - MDD patients. We interacted with several people who had experienced depressive episodes or been diagnosed with MDD and other mental illnesses to gain insight into what a good diagnosis tool should look like throughout our project journey. 

However, OASYS is not a home-based tool. Instead, it is aimed at clinicians and other Mental Health Professionals. Having recognized various other applications for our tool (find our iHP story here!), in both research and pharmaceutical fields, we ensured to consider the potentials and the challenges of OASYS in the real world by discussing our project with various psychiatrists, psychologists, neuroscientists, and pharmacological experts. 
<br>
<br>What do the patients want?<br>
Through our surveys and outreach activities, we connected with people who have been diagnosed with MDD to understand what they would want from a tool that analyses biomarker levels to screen for MDD. We reached out to MDD patients through our survey, which received 25 responses.
<br> 48% of the patients believe that the diagnosis process was time-consuming 
<br>64% of the patients agreed that the main reason for the financial difficulties during the diagnosis process was due to the limited availability of accessible mental health services. 
<br>72% of the patients say that there may not be any data privacy-related problems with a blood test for the diagnosis.
<br>60% of the patients feel like a blood-based tool that can analyze fluctuating biomarker levels would make a real difference in their lives. An objective tool can help solidify the fact that MDD is in fact real. 
<br>48% of the patients think that a solid diagnosis would make a difference in their social life, making it easier for them to explain to people about MDD. 
<br>60% of the patients confirm that a blood-based diagnostic tool will bring positive changes to the work environment, by reducing the stigma around depression, acknowledging it as a real disease with physical symptoms and helping avail timely treatment
<br>Overall, 72% of the patients feel like the experience of diagnosis and living with an invisible disability like MDD can be made better with increased mental health awareness and education 

<br>
<p>OASYS as a diagnostic tool <br>
Our goal with OASYS is to make an objective and sensitive Point of Care Testing (PoCT) tool that can aid the process of MDD diagnosis. Its user-friendly and accessible design lends itself the potential to be an effective diagnostic aid.

The current biomarkers chosen by us are putative and not validated by any clinical trials except for literature data. Once the reliability of the chosen biomarkers is established, the next step would be to find out the specific threshold blood levels for each biomarker through subsequent clinical trials, Thus, slowly but surely, OASYS can be integrated into current process of MDD diagnosis as an effective objective aid. Our tool is meant to benefit MDD patients.

However, OASYS is not a home-based tool. Instead, it is aimed at clinicians and other Mental Health Professionals, intended to complement the current diagnostic methods. In no way is OASYS meant to be a self-diagnostic tool. Rather, the analysis of readings given by the chip can only be done by clinicians. This avoids any misuse of the chip considering the lack of awareness and sensitivity around mental illnesses. 
</p>

<p>However, OASYS is more than just a diagnostic tool.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
OASYS as a research tool 
<br>
As mentioned earlier, one of the primary problems we faced during the background research of our project was the severe lack of data regarding blood biomarkers related to mental health illnesses. Since more data needs to be collected to establish the correlation between the biomarkers and MDD, the initial  users of our tool would be the scientific community.
Talking to Dr Srikumar from NIMHANS, we realized that OASYS can help build biomarker data that can help in scientific research advancements in the field of psychiatric illnesses. It can also help in novel drug development of antidepressants for MDD. Biomarker researchers, psychopharmacologists, clinical and psychiatry researchers can use our tool to help with research in their fields. Dr Varsha Singh, a cognitive psychologist from IIT Delhi, mentioned how “Biomarker research in mental illnesses needs to catch up”. In line with that goal, data collection through clinical trials and population studies can be made easier with the help of OASYS. Analysis of these could reveal the potential of each biomolecule as a biomarker for MDD. 
Our microfluidic device is not just a solution to misdiagnosis, but hopefully a catalyst for future groundbreaking research. <br>
</p>
<p>
OASYS as a prognostic tool <br>
A person’s blood biomarker levels could be easily plotted using a tool like OASYS. Understanding and studying the biomarker profile of individuals diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) opens up the opportunity to tailor precise antidepressant treatment strategies for patients. This will considerably diminish reliance on trial-and-error approaches by the physician, as pointed out to us by Dr Srikumar, consequently aiding the paradigm shift toward personalized medicine.
</p>
<br>
<p>
OASYS for antidepressant tracking
<br>
The assessment of the response and efficacy of antidepressant treatment in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients can be conducted by analyzing changes in biomarker levels within the blood. This would entail undergoing multiple microfluidic blood assays over a specific prescription period. This analytical approach shifts the focus from behavioral changes to analyzing biological alterations, providing a more nuanced and objective evaluation of treatment outcomes.

        <p>

          <a id="head4"></a>
          As mentioned in the TRL analysis of our project, we are currently at TRL level 4.
          There were a lot of things we planned to do that we weren't able to do due to time, financial, and competition constraints. However, talking to relevant stakeholders like Anvaya Biotech and  Vidcare Innovations boosted our spirits to keep working on OASYS even after the iGEM competition since it would be a start of, or at least be a catalyst in the field of PoCT in mental healthcare. We realized that the preliminary design of the device proposed for the competition will have to undergo several optimizations to comply with the safety, qualitative and technical requirements. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Biomarkers <br>

          The primary challenge in attempting to devise a biomarker-based diagnosis for MDD lies not just in the absence of specific established markers but also in the stagnation observed in the research of biomarkers for mental health disorders. We were faced with an acute lack of biomarker data when it came to MDD and this was also affirmed by the words of Dr Krishnan S, the HoD of psychiatry at Govt Medical College and Lekha Dinesh Kumar, a scientist working on cancer research at thе Cеntrе for Cеllular and Molеcular Biology. (Find the detailed report of their inputs on our iHP timeline). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, we have chosen 5 biomarkers that showed the most literature and experts’ backup. We have also compiled a preliminary list of the same kinds of biomarkers and biomarker functions related to MDD which shows almost similar degree of potential to be biological biomarkers of MDD. The exact pathways in which these work to co-relate with MDD is something that is yet to be explored and, again, currently facing a severe lack of data.

              <li>Cytokines and inflammatory markers</li>
              <ul>
                <li> Inflammatory mediators have been found to affect many factors (monoamine and glutamate neurotransmission, GR resistance, and hippocampal neurogenesis) that are thought to be important in the etiopathogenesis of MDD. This suggests that inflammatory markers may be used as a marker for the diagnosis and treatment response of depression 
                </li>
                <li> IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are known as pro-inflammatory cytokines, and IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 are known as anti-inflammatory cytokines -
                  they play a role in the maintenance of normal brain function by supporting neuronal integrity, neurogenesis, and synaptic remodeling 
                </li>
                <li> 
                  Cytokines released by peripheral immune cells and adipose tissue enter the central nervous system (CNS) through some regions of the blood-brain barrier or by the active reuptake mechanism and thereby affect behaviors. </li>
                <li>Of the inflammatory markers, those which most confirm the changes in depression are proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNFα, and C reactive protein (CRP) 
                  Serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα and the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions of these in peripheral cells are increased in patients with MDD ,elevated levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα prior to treatment have been reported to be associated with non-response to antidepressant treatment 
                </li>
                
                <li> Pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate IDO in glial cells. IDO converts the tryptophan to kynurenine, which is then converted to neurotoxic quinolinic acid in the brain. Quinolinic acid binds to N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Thus, because of the pro-inflammatory cytokines inducing IDO, depression may develop as a result of the decrease in serotonin levels due to reduced tryptophan on the one hand and glutamatergic neurotoxicity on the other.</li>
                <li>Serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα and the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions of these in peripheral cells are increased in patients with MDD ,elevated levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNFα prior to treatment have been reported to be associated with non-response to antidepressant treatment. </li>
                <li>Cytokine levels differ for some subtypes of depression. increase in proinflammatory cytokines in those attempting suicide, in depression with suicidal ideas, and in geriatric depression whereas atypical and melancholic depressions show increased levels of CRP and IL-6 compared to typical depressions. 
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>miR-144-5p </li>
              <li> Oxidative stress markers </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Increased oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant defenses exist in MDD, and that specific components of oxidative stress play a role in the pathophysiology of depression.
                </li>
                <li>Levels of lipid peroxidation products such as malondialdehyde (MDA) have been reported to be generally elevated in depressed patients. There are also studies reporting that MDA levels are higher in patients with recurrent depression than in those with a single episode. In depressed patients, several studies have reported that serum SOD is decreased or that erythrocyte SOD is increased .

                </li>
                <li>A meta-analysis of 17 trials evaluating the majority of lipid peroxidation markers in MDD found that these markers were elevated in patients with depression and found an association between the levels of these and the severity of depression.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Growth Factors</li>
              <ul>
                <li>A reduction in the hippocampal BDNF activity might be directly related to the pathophysiology of MDD, a stress-related disease. 
                </li>
                <li>BDNF changes are not specific to depression. For instance, the reduction is observed for both bipolar disorder and MDD, although serum BDNF levels are reported to be lower in bipolar depression compared to MDD 
                </li>

        <p>Wetlab <br>
          <p> Temperature based assays for Aptasensors <br>
            Performing temperature-based assays for our aptasensor experiments can be crucial due to the change in aptamer binding affinity which can be temperature-dependent. This is because temperature could affect the secondary structure of the aptamer, which can in turn affect its ability to bind to its target, which in our case is the cDNA strand for the formation of the aptasensor and also the biomolecule once the cDNA has been displaced. 
            For example, some aptamers may have a higher affinity for their target at lower temperatures, while others may have a higher affinity for their target at higher temperatures. Therefore, performing temperature-based assays can help to identify the optimal temperature for aptamer binding. Therefore running the hybridisation fluorescence based experiments for the formation and sensitivity of our aptasensors in varying temperatures will not only aim to hasten the formation of the quantifier molecules but could also in theory provide us with optimal temperature conditions for increased sensitivity of the aptasensor. In addition, temperature-based assays can also be used to study the thermodynamics of aptamer binding. This information can be used to design aptasensors with improved binding affinity and stability. 
          </p>
          <p>ITC experiments for nanoprobe <br>
            Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) is a powerful technique that directly measures the heat changes associated with molecular interactions, allowing the determination of thermodynamic parameters of binding events, including enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and the binding constant (Ka). When studying DNA-DNA binding, such as during the formation of DNA duplexes or the interaction between specific DNA sequences, ITC offers several advantages:
            <ul>
            <li>Direct Measurement: ITC provides direct measurement of the binding enthalpy. Unlike other methods where binding constants are the primary data obtained, and thermodynamics must be inferred or calculated, ITC directly measures heat, allowing for a direct determination of ΔH. </li>
            
            <li>No Labeling Required: ITC doesn't require any labeling of the molecules involved. Many other techniques, like fluorescence or radioactivity-based assays, need tags that might interfere with the binding event or alter the properties of the molecules.</li> 
            
           <li> Comprehensive Thermodynamic Profile: ITC can provide a complete thermodynamic profile of the binding event in a single experiment. It allows determination of ΔH, ΔS, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG), and the binding constant (K_a or K_d). </li>
            
           <li> Solution-based Measurement: ITC measurements are done in solution, which means that the natural three-dimensional conformation and dynamics of the molecules are retained, ensuring biologically relevant data. </li>
            
           <li> Multiple Binding Sites: ITC can distinguish between multiple binding sites with different affinities on the same molecule, which can be useful when studying complex systems or interactions with multiple stages. Since it shows multiple binding sites, it’s advantageous since it can prove binding of three different hybridizing sequences together to form the probe.</li>
            
           <li> No Need for Separation Steps: After binding occurs in an ITC experiment, there's no need to separate bound from unbound molecules. This is a contrast to techniques like gel-shift assays, where separation steps can introduce variability or inaccuracies. </li>
            
            <li>Determination of Stoichiometry: ITC not only provides information about the strength and thermodynamics of binding but also about the stoichiometry of the interaction, revealing how many molecules of one type bind to the other. </li>
            
           <li> Probing Molecular Details: By comparing ITC data from experiments conducted with modified DNA sequences or conditions, it's possible to probe the role of specific bases or structural elements in the binding interaction. This can help in understanding the molecular basis for specificity or the role of certain regions in DNA binding. </li>
          </ul>

        <br>
        <p>
          In addressing the safety concerns of this tool, the diagnostic procedure does not endanger the patient since it only requires a blood sample. We strongly propose that this examination take place only in suitable facilities of medical supervision such as a hospital or a diagnostic lab- ensuring that the patient's examination will be conducted by qualified staff. Also, the proposed visualization-quantification software will automatically provide the degree of risk to MDD preventing any human errors in the result analysis </p>
         <p>
         To continue working on the project, we need access to blood samples in order to improve the accuracy and specificity of our quantifiers in blood. To know more about the details of permissions and safety regarding the collection and use of blood samples, we contacted Dr Annapoorna, from GMC Cochin
         </p>
         <p>The use of blood samples of MDD patients requires prior approval from the institute's ethics committee. We are also required to submit a proposal for the project to an investigator from the Department of Psychiatry, Thiruvananthapuram. 
          Some additional measures we will have to take in order to keep in line with the ethical guidelines and ensure safety throughout the process of sample collection are:  
          <ul>
          <li>Consent of the patient will be mandatory and privacy of data collected will be ensured.</li>
          <li>The medical history of the person will also be collected to know if the blood sample should be treated with additional precautions. </li>
          <li>The experiments involving blood can proceed in the Bio Safety Level 1 (BSL 1) laboratory, as our research does not involve the study of any pathogens present in blood. </li>
          <li>In our meeting with Mr Rohan Agarwal (INSERT LINK), it was brought up that the blood to be discarded and materials or surfaces that are exposed to blood should be disinfected using sodium hypochlorite. </li>
