          One of our team members then opened up about their struggle with depression. 
          They recounted their multiple inconclusive doctor visits and difficulty in receiving 
          a proper diagnosis. Learning about the process of diagnosing depression, we learned 
          about the shortcomings of the current methods. We noticed that the only commercially 
          available diagnostic tools for depression are self-report questionnaires, clinical 
          interviews, or invasive techniques such as spinal tapping, which are not feasible 
          and unaffordable to a notable percentage of society.

              We consulted three professional psychiatrists from the Government Medical College, 
              Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India to better understand the scale of the issue.
              Psychiatrists told us about how often they meet patients who confess to 
              trying to manipulate the questionnaires for fear of being diagnosed with depression.
              They spoke about the stigma associated with mental illnesses, particularly depression.
              Interactions with peers who were diagnosed with depression brought to light their 
              dissatisfaction with the existing methods. All this strengthened our motivation 
              to fulfill the need for a reliable and comprehensive diagnostic test for depression.

            Existing blood-biomarker-based kits rely on a single biomarker,
            which is non-specific, unreliable and inconclusive for a 
            heterogeneous disorder like MDD. To tackle this, we decided to 
            use five different biomarkers - one neurotransmitter, two miRNAs,
            one hormone, and one protein.<sup><a href = "#ref21">[21]</a></sup>

            sensors will detect and analyse. Microfluidic chips can be designed 
            to be compact, cost-effective, and can be sensitised to give more

            Oasys is not limited to its use as a diagnostic kit for depression, 
            it can also be used to monitor the efficacy of antidepressant treatment in patients. 
            It will help the doctor personalize the drug combinations and dosage, 
            catering to the individual's needs. We are working to expand the 
            number of biomarkers used in the kit with similar quantification 
            methods so as to further increase the sensitivity of the kit. 
            Although our kit is made to diagnose clinical depression, 
            its flexible design can be extended to various other diseases 
            with similar biomarkers.

        <a id="subsubhead01"></a>
        <p>

          MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs. Most miRNAs are transcribed 
          from the DNA sequence into primary miRNAs and then processed into precursor 
          and mature miRNAs. Our project makes use of miRNAs 124 and 132. <u>Multiple 
          studies have observed the upregulation of these miRNAs</u> in clinically 
          depressed patients.<sup><a href = "#ref25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href = "#ref26">[26]</a></sup> 
          We chose miRNAs as they are well-studied and easily accessible from blood, serum and other body fluids.

        <h3 class = "font-head">Hormone - Cortisol</h3>
        <a id="subsubhead03"></a>
        <p>
          The fourth biomarker is cortisol, widely known as the body's stress hormone. 
          Hormones are chemical messengers found in multicellular organisms that affect 
          psychology and behaviour. Cortisol is a steroid hormone in the glucocorticoid 
          class that plays an important role in stress response. Studies indicate that 
          <u>higher cortisol levels in blood</u> are well correlated with the occurrence and severity of MDD.

          The GSα protein is the fifth biomarker chosen for our project. 
          G proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, 
          are proteins that serve as a molecular switch inside cells, 
          transmitting signals from external stimuli to the cell's interior.  
          G-proteins and RGS (Regulators of G protein signalling) proteins 
          are two protein families that are deeply engaged in both the onset 
          of depressed states and the action of antidepressant medications. 
          This novel biomarker was <u>shown to be present in lower concentrations 
          in clinically depressed patients.</u> <sup><a href = "#ref29">[29]</a></sup>

        Nanoprobes are small, nano-sized devices that interact with a biomolecule and can 
        be used for diagnostic purposes. Our nanoprobe comprises a magnetic nanoparticle 
        with an attached molecular beacon that produces fluorescence through a fluorophore-quencher pair. 
        The molecular beacon is single-stranded DNA with three prominent parts: one complementary 
        to the target miRNA, one attached to a fluorophore, and one attached to a quencher. 
        A fluorophore is a molecule that can exhibit fluorescence, while a quencher can 
        inhibit the fluorophore’s ability to fluoresce. When inert, the nanoprobe exists in a 
        hairpin structure, and the probe holds the quencher near the fluorophore, thus emitting no signal. 
        When the target miRNA binds to the probe, the target-probe hybridisation can open the hairpin, 
        forming an active "Y" structure. This active structure separates the fluorophore and the quencher, 
        resulting in fluorescence emission. We will further enhance detection by attaching the molecular 
        beacon to magnetic nanoparticles to focus fluorescence on a smaller area <sup><a href = "#ref30">[30]</a></sup>

            Aptamers are artificially synthesised single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences that can easily change conformations, 
            allowing them to bind to specific targets with high affinity. They hence can be used in biosensing for clinical 
            diagnostics. FRET is a non-radiative energy transfer process 
            that occurs over small-scale separations (usually in nanometers) between an emitter (donor) and an absorber 
            molecule (acceptor), often called a ‘FRET’ pair. We have chosen a fluorophore and a quencher as the 
            donor-acceptor FRET pair.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our project, we combine these two concepts to create FRET aptamers. The FRET aptamer contains a fluorophore, 
            and the cDNA has a quencher attached to it so that while the cDNA is bound, the fluorophores transfer energy to the quencher, 
            and fluorescence is not observed. However, in the presence of the target protein, the FRET aptamers bind to the 
            target protein, displacing the cDNA. With no quencher in the vicinity, the fluorophore will give a detectable fluorescent signal. 
            These FRET Aptamers are used to quantify the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone cortisol, and GSα protein.  <sup><a href = "#ref31">[31]</a></sup>

              The design involves five channels, one for each biomarker. The blood sample is introduced to the main port, 
              which is equally divided into all the channels through valves and pumps. 
              Each channel has different chambers, called mixers, that contain the quantifiers:
              magnetic nanoprobes for miRNAs and FRET aptamers for serotonin, cortisol, and Gsα. 
              These mixers are chosen based on the specific conditions required for the quantifier 
              to attach to the biomarkers. Once the quantifiers bind to the biomarkers, 
              we flow them into transparent chambers where fluorimetric sensors can sense 
              the fluorescence and give us a measurement of the biomarkers.<sup><a href = "#ref33">[33]</a></sup>

            Although the iGEM competition cycle concludes in November 2023, 
            continued innovation using synthetic biology is the true vision 
            of iGEM and is a continuous endeavour. We would like to share our 
            results with the broader scientific community. Going through the 
            peer-review process and obtaining expert feedback will help us 
            improve our experiment choice, data interpretation and presentation. 
            We want to demonstrate a more robust and complete proof of concept of our idea. 
            We plan to explore and incorporate more biomarkers into the kit to increase the 
            test's sensitivity. We will also update our protocol with pioneering changes in 
            measurement and quantification to help make the kit as affordable as possible.
