          One of our team members then opened up about their struggle with depression. 
          They recounted their multiple inconclusive doctor visits and difficulty in receiving 
          a proper diagnosis. Learning about the process of diagnosing depression, we learned 
          about the shortcomings of the current methods. We noticed that the only commercially 
          available diagnostic tools for depression are self-report questionnaires, clinical 
          interviews, or invasive techniques such as spinal tapping, which are not feasible 
          and unaffordable to a notable percentage of society.

             </p>
             <p>
              We consulted three professional psychiatrists from the Government Medical College, 
              Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India to better understand the scale of the issue.
              Psychiatrists told us about how often they meet patients who confess to 
              trying to manipulate the questionnaires for fear of being diagnosed with depression.
              They spoke about the stigma associated with mental illnesses, particularly depression.
              Interactions with peers who were diagnosed with depression brought to light their 
              dissatisfaction with the existing methods. All this strengthened our motivation 
              to fulfill the need for a reliable and comprehensive diagnostic test for depression.

            Existing blood-biomarker-based kits rely on a single biomarker,
            which is non-specific, unreliable and inconclusive for a 
            heterogeneous disorder like MDD. To tackle this, we decided to

            sensors will detect and analyse. Microfluidic chips can be designed

          Wе undеrtook thе task of translating thеir promotional vidеo script into Malayalam, 
          making thеir contеnt accеssiblе to a broadеr and morе divеrsе audiеncе. 
          Inclusivity is not just a word but a commitmеnt and this еffort showcasеd our

              The design involves five channels, one for each biomarker. The blood sample is introduced to the main port, 
              which is equally divided into all the channels through valves and pumps. 
              Each channel has different chambers, called mixers, that contain the quantifiers:
              magnetic nanoprobes for miRNAs and FRET aptamers for serotonin, cortisol, and Gsα. 
              These mixers are chosen based on the specific conditions required for the quantifier 
              to attach to the biomarkers. Once the quantifiers bind to the biomarkers, 
              we flow them into transparent chambers where fluorimetric sensors can sense 
              the fluorescence and give us a measurement of the biomarkers.<sup><a href = "#ref33">[33]</a></sup>

            Although the iGEM competition cycle concludes in November 2023, 
            continued innovation using synthetic biology is the true vision 
            of iGEM and is a continuous endeavour. We would like to share our 
            results with the broader scientific community. Going through the 
            peer-review process and obtaining expert feedback will help us 
            improve our experiment choice, data interpretation and presentation. 
            We want to demonstrate a more robust and complete proof of concept of our idea. 
            We plan to explore and incorporate more biomarkers into the kit to increase the 
            test's sensitivity. We will also update our protocol with pioneering changes in 
            measurement and quantification to help make the kit as affordable as possible.

            By incorporating certain modifications to our system, 
            in the future, we will be able to broaden the scope of our 
            project from major depressive disorder to other diseases with similar biomarkers. 
            We will work on collecting the population data to set a threshold level for the biomarkers.

            We are trying to register our product under Kerala Startup Mission, 
            an initiative from the Kerala government to support and foster budding innovations. 
            By exploring the many avenues of entrepreneurship available to us and analysing 
            the bottlenecks for upscaling, we wish to translate our work into a tangible 
            product for our community and the world.

          <a id="subhead33"></a>
          <p> 
            We also propose a mental well-being tracking app to be implemented in the future, 
            which will help patients under medication track the biomarker levels in their blood, 
            remind them to take medication and keep up with regular appointments with a doctor. 
            The app will also help patients regulate their sleep cycle and help maintain a 
            healthy diet adding up to the individual's overall well-being.
