          The current standard for diagnosing MDD relies on self-report questionnaires, which can be subjective and prone to bias. In an effort to provide a more reliable and objective diagnostic tool, we have developed a blood-based biomarker kit to diagnose depression. This approach involves the use of a functional microfluidic chip test kit that utilizes fret [1-give href] -based technology.
Our main goal is to introduce an affordable, user-friendly biomarker-based diagnostic tool for MDD. The microfluidic chip is inserted into a slot of a 3D printed box that has an LCD screen, an Arduino UNO set up, and necessary accessories. Once the microfluidic chip is inserted, the blue LED inside the hardware setup excites the sample, and the fluorescence emitted is detected by the photodarlington. The intensity of fluorescence measured is then displayed on the LCD screen, and all the readings are controlled by the microcontroller Arduino UNO. This prototype is made for showing the working, using the most basic components and with least complications.

          The development of a device capable of detecting biological samples requires the integration of various components. This device has a unique design that allows it to accurately identify fluorescence in a sample.The outer shell of the device is being 3D printed using PLA(Polylactic acid) a thermoplastic monomer derived from renewable, organic sources such as corn starch or sugar cane. The main components of the device include a photodarlington (also known as a photodarlington transistor or photodarlington sensor, operates based on the principle of photoelectric effect and amplification.), Customized LED of 480 nm, ARDUINO UNO[It is a microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P], 16-bit ADC converter[this will make the measurements more precise], and an LCD screen. These components work together to create an ultra-sensitive device that can detect fluorescence which is not generally visible to the naked eye. The device's inside is pitch black to ensure maximum absorption of blue light and avoid any interference.
When the microfluidic chip is inserted into the slot of the device, the 480 nm specific LED will excite the sample, and the photodarlington placed directly above the sample, will detect the most feeble fluorescence. The device's design is such that it can screen the noise created by blue light, ensuring that the fluorescence value is not affected.

          There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
