          <p>And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one.</p>
          <p>It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.</p>
          <p>Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not know exactly how to take them.</p>

        <div class='col-sm-6'>
          <p>At first they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only way he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.</p>

Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.</p>

          Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex, multifactorial,
          and heterogeneous clinical syndrome that currently affects 
          at least 120 million people worldwide and, by 2030, will be 
          the single highest contributor to the global disease burden <sup><a href = "#ref1">[1]</a></sup>. 
          The currently commercially available diagnostic methods for 
          depression are either self-report questionnaires and clinical
          interviews, which can be subjective and prone to variability  <sup><a href = "#ref2">[2]</a></sup>,
          or techniques like spinal tapping, which are inaccessible,
          unaffordable and invasive. Millions of people with depression 
          suffer because they do not have access to professional help
          that starts with a diagnosis. Our project Oasys, is a 
          'Blood-biomarker-based diagnostic kit' for MDD. 
          Oasys can objectively measure biological markers associated with MDD, 
          such as  neurotransmitters, microRNAs, hormones and the proteins. 
          Our approach will reduce the dependence on self-reported symptoms
          and improve the accuracy of diagnosis <sup><a href = "#ref3">[3]</a></sup>.

        In the early ideation process for iGEM, 
        our team kept running into multiple news 
        stories about the increasing suicide rates
        in higher educational institutions across
        India <sup><a href = "#ref4">[4]</a></sup>
        <sup><a href = "#ref5">[5]</a></sup>.
        Depression is one of the 
        leading causes of suicide in India and
        across the world <sup><a href = "#ref6">[6]</a></sup>,
        and the shocking statistics we encountered prompted us to 
        better understand the root cause of this phenomenon.

          One of our team members then opened up about their struggle with depression. 
          They recounted their multiple inconclusive doctor visits and difficulty in receiving 
          a proper diagnosis. Learning about the process of diagnosing depression, we learned 
          about the shortcomings of the current methods. We noticed that the only commercially 
          available diagnostic tools for depression are self-report questionnaires, clinical 
          interviews, or invasive techniques such as spinal tapping, which are not feasible 
          and unaffordable to a notable percentage of society.

             </p>
             <p>
              We consulted three professional psychiatrists from the Government Medical College, 
              Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India to better understand the scale of the issue.
              Psychiatrists told us about how often they meet patients who confess to 
              trying to manipulate the questionnaires for fear of being diagnosed with depression.
              They spoke about the stigma associated with mental illnesses, particularly depression.
              Interactions with peers who were diagnosed with depression brought to light their 
              dissatisfaction with the existing methods. All this strengthened our motivation 
              to fulfill the need for a reliable and comprehensive diagnostic test for depression.

          The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted mental health globally.
          The pandemic has revealed that mental health and psychological care support
           is vitiated by a scarcity of resources and inadequate information. 
           Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the global prevalence of anxiety and 
           depression increased by a massive 25%, according to a scientific brief 
           released by the World Health Organization (WHO)<sup><a href = "#ref7">[7]</a></sup>. 
             Isolation, grief, 
             economic challenges, and uncertainties related to the pandemic have 
             increased the risk of depression and exacerbated existing mental health 
             conditions. A recent study found that during the COVID-19 pandemic; in Kerala, 
             depression was a major problem faced by people under home quarantine (75.2%), 
             followed by stigma (69.5%) and anxiety (69.4%) <sup><a href = "#ref8">[8]</a></sup>. 
             The growing burden of chronic diseases, declining social capital and
              greater inequality and loneliness are central to rising rates of depression.
               The Kerala state report of the National Mental Health Survey reported an overall 
               prevalence of mental disorders of 11.36% <sup><a href = "#ref9">[9]</a></sup>. 
               The National Crime Records Bureau reported that the overall incidence rate 
               of suicide per 100,000 persons in Kerala was 23.5, which is double the 
               national rate <sup><a href = "#ref10">[10]</a></sup>. 
               The number of individuals with mental health illnesses in the state increased 
               from 272 people per 100,000 to 400 people per 100,000 from 2002 to 2018 <sup><a href = "#ref11">[11]</a></sup>. 
               Kerala experienced a rapid rise in mental health morbidity in the last decade. 
               The state's most recently reported human health resource and infrastructure 
               availability appears inadequate to cater to mental healthcare requirements, 
               even as improvements and upgrades are underway.

          Despite the prevalence of mental illness, progress in 
          developing accurate diagnostics has been slow. Some laboratory
           tests are available for the diagnosis of depression however they 
           are unviable due to high cost or slow results<sup><a href = "#ref12">[12]</a></sup>. The dexamethasone 
           suppression test (DST) is one such diagnostic blood test that measures 
           the suppression of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 
           which regulates the glucocorticoid stress hormone cortisol. 
           However, it is not commonly used due to its non-specificity, poor sensitivity and non-suppression.
           <sup><a href = "#ref13">[13]</a></sup>. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is 
           another procedure used to diagnose depression. However, it is not 
           extensively used as it is invasive, expensive, and there is a 
           high risk of infection<sup><a href = "#ref14">[14]</a></sup>. 
           We realised that one single biomarker cannot accurately diagnose 
           a disorder as heterogeneous as MDD and that there is a need for 
           a non-invasive, sensitive and reliable point-of-care diagnostics 
           for depression. We intend to use the potential of synthetic biology 
           to create unique and efficient quantitative approaches for properly 
           determining biomarker plasma levels and producing a trustworthy and 
           readable final result.
           We have also drawn inspiration from multiple previous iGEM teams -

            <li style="font-size: medium;">Team Moscow 2021 (miPression) - They worked extensively on a

              Their project made us realise the need for a diagnostic kit for 
              depression and inspired us to select biomarkers such as microRNAs.<sup><a href = "#ref15">[15]</a></sup>

          Having extensively researched the diagnostic procedures available for MDD, 
          we realised that there is a need for a diagnostic kit that can produce 
          objective final readings. Blood tests are well-known to be a reliable 
          form of assessing a person's risk for a disorder, identifying the best 
          treatment options, and monitoring treatment success. Compared to 
          procedures like CSF analysis and neuroimaging, they are cost and 
          time effective and are easily accessible by the general population, clinicians 
          and health professionals. Thus, we decided to use a blood-biomarker 
          diagnosis approach for MDD.<sup><a href = "#ref20">[20]</a></sup> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Existing blood-biomarker-based kits rely on a single biomarker,
            which is non-specific, unreliable and inconclusive for a 
            heterogeneous disorder like MDD. To tackle this, we decided to 
            use five different biomarkers - one neurotransmitter, two miRNAs,
            one hormone, and one protein.<sup><a href = "#ref21">[21]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will integrate our quantification assays into a microfluidic 
            chip for fast, readable results. The quantifiers emit a fluorescent 
            signal upon binding to the target biomarkers, which fluorimetric 
            sensors will detect and analyse. Microfluidic chips can be designed 
            to be compact, cost-effective, and can be sensitised to give more 
            conclusive test results.<sup><a href = "#ref22">[22]</a></sup>

          Oasys is a novel and objective blood-biomarker-based diagnostic kit 
          for clinical depression that uses a neurotransmitter, two microRNAs, 
          a hormone, and a protein as the biomarkers in human peripheral blood serum. 
          We intend to use the potential of synthetic biology and synthesise 
          FRET(<i>Förster</i> or fluorescence resonance energy transfer)-based aptamers and magnetic nanoprobes that produce fluorescence 
          to quantify and estimate biomarker concentrations. 
          We plan on designing and engineering a viable microchip-based test kit. 
          We will develop a prototype with fluorometric sensors that can input a 
          human blood sample and quantify biomarker concentrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oasys is not limited to its use as a diagnostic kit for depression, 
            it can also be used to monitor the efficacy of antidepressant treatment in patients. 
            It will help the doctor personalize the drug combinations and dosage, 
            catering to the individual's needs. We are working to expand the 
            number of biomarkers used in the kit with similar quantification 
            methods so as to further increase the sensitivity of the kit. 
            Although our kit is made to diagnose clinical depression, 
            its flexible design can be extended to various other diseases 
            with similar biomarkers.

        <a id="subsubhead02"></a>  
        <p>
          Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemical messengers that help neurons 
          throughout the body communicate with each other. Neurotransmitters amplify, 
          transmit, and convert signals in cells, and through chemical synaptic transmission, 
          they help with various brain functions.<sup><a href = "#ref23">[23]</a></sup> 
          We use the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) as the first biomarker in our kit. 
          <u>Serotonin levels in the blood have been shown to decrease</u> in patients with depression. <sup><a href = "#ref24">[24]</a></sup>

        <h3 class = "font-head" id = "subsubhead01">miRNAs -124 & 132</h3>
        <a id="subsubhead01"></a>
        <p>

          MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs. Most miRNAs are transcribed 
          from the DNA sequence into primary miRNAs and then processed into precursor 
          and mature miRNAs. Our project makes use of miRNAs 124 and 132. <u>Multiple 
          studies have observed the upregulation of these miRNAs</u> in clinically 
          depressed patients.<sup><a href = "#ref25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href = "#ref26">[26]</a></sup> 
          We chose miRNAs as they are well-studied and easily accessible from blood, serum and other body fluids.

        <h3 class = "font-head">Hormone - Cortisol</h3>
        <a id="subsubhead03"></a>
        <p>
          The fourth biomarker is cortisol, widely known as the body's stress hormone. 
          Hormones are chemical messengers found in multicellular organisms that affect 
          psychology and behaviour. Cortisol is a steroid hormone in the glucocorticoid 
          class that plays an important role in stress response. Studies indicate that 
          <u>higher cortisol levels in blood</u> are well correlated with the occurrence and severity of MDD.

        <a id="subsubhead04"></a>

          The GSα protein is the fifth biomarker chosen for our project. 
          G proteins, also known as guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, 
          are proteins that serve as a molecular switch inside cells, 
          transmitting signals from external stimuli to the cell's interior.  
          G-proteins and RGS (Regulators of G protein signalling) proteins 
          are two protein families that are deeply engaged in both the onset 
          of depressed states and the action of antidepressant medications. 
          This novel biomarker was <u>shown to be present in lower concentrations

        Nanoprobes are small, nano-sized devices that interact with a biomolecule and can 
        be used for diagnostic purposes. Our nanoprobe comprises a magnetic nanoparticle 
        with an attached molecular beacon that produces fluorescence through a fluorophore-quencher pair. 
        The molecular beacon is single-stranded DNA with three prominent parts: one complementary 
        to the target miRNA, one attached to a fluorophore, and one attached to a quencher. 
        A fluorophore is a molecule that can exhibit fluorescence, while a quencher can 
        inhibit the fluorophore’s ability to fluoresce. When inert, the nanoprobe exists in a 
        hairpin structure, and the probe holds the quencher near the fluorophore, thus emitting no signal. 
        When the target miRNA binds to the probe, the target-probe hybridisation can open the hairpin, 
        forming an active "Y" structure. This active structure separates the fluorophore and the quencher, 
        resulting in fluorescence emission. We will further enhance detection by attaching the molecular 
        beacon to magnetic nanoparticles to focus fluorescence on a smaller area <sup><a href = "#ref30">[30]</a></sup>

            Aptamers are artificially synthesised single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences that can easily change conformations, 
            allowing them to bind to specific targets with high affinity. They hence can be used in biosensing for clinical 
            diagnostics. FRET is a non-radiative energy transfer process 
            that occurs over small-scale separations (usually in nanometers) between an emitter (donor) and an absorber 
            molecule (acceptor), often called a ‘FRET’ pair. We have chosen a fluorophore and a quencher as the 
            donor-acceptor FRET pair.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our project, we combine these two concepts to create FRET aptamers. The FRET aptamer contains a fluorophore, 
            and the cDNA has a quencher attached to it so that while the cDNA is bound, the fluorophores transfer energy to the quencher, 
            and fluorescence is not observed. However, in the presence of the target protein, the FRET aptamers bind to the 
            target protein, displacing the cDNA. With no quencher in the vicinity, the fluorophore will give a detectable fluorescent signal. 
            These FRET Aptamers are used to quantify the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone cortisol, and GSα protein.  <sup><a href = "#ref31">[31]</a></sup>

              The design involves five channels, one for each biomarker. The blood sample is introduced to the main port, 
              which is equally divided into all the channels through valves and pumps. 
              Each channel has different chambers, called mixers, that contain the quantifiers:
              magnetic nanoprobes for miRNAs and FRET aptamers for serotonin, cortisol, and Gsα. 
              These mixers are chosen based on the specific conditions required for the quantifier 
              to attach to the biomarkers. Once the quantifiers bind to the biomarkers, 
              we flow them into transparent chambers where fluorimetric sensors can sense

            continued innovation using synthetic biology is the true vision 
            of iGEM and is a continuous endeavour. We would like to share our

            peer-review process and obtaining expert feedback will help us 
            improve our experiment choice, data interpretation and presentation. 
            We want to demonstrate a more robust and complete proof of concept of our idea.

            We will work on collecting the population data to set a threshold level for the biomarkers.

            We are trying to register our product under Kerala Startup Mission, 
            an initiative from the Kerala government to support and foster budding innovations. 
            By exploring the many avenues of entrepreneurship available to us and analysing 
            the bottlenecks for upscaling, we wish to translate our work into a tangible 
            product for our community and the world.

          <a id="subhead33"></a>
          <p> 
            We also propose a mental well-being tracking app to be implemented in the future, 
            which will help patients under medication track the biomarker levels in their blood, 
            remind them to take medication and keep up with regular appointments with a doctor. 
            The app will also help patients regulate their sleep cycle and help maintain a 
            healthy diet adding up to the individual's overall well-being.

    <h2>Before you start</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Please read the following pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki" target="_blank">Wiki Requirements page</a></li>

    <h2>Styling your wiki</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Feel free to customize the page styling according to your preferences, or you can simply leave the style as it is. It's wise to focus on a clear content first, and on a clean design later.</p>
    <p>Be cautious with the size of the assets like images, videos, and more into your wiki. Large file sizes can hinder the presentation of wikis due to slow internet connections. Remember to compress large files before uploading them to iGEM servers.</p>
    <p>This default wiki meets the requirements, enhances navigability, and provides a user-friendly experience for visitors. You should not feel obliged to go beyond the provided styling.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This wiki will be your team's first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.</li>
      <li>Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.</li>
      <li>You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.</li>
      <li>Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.</li>
      <li>Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.</li>
      <li>Start documenting your project as early as possible; don't leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the <a href="https://competition.igem.org/calendar" target="_blank">iGEM Competition calendar</a></li>
      <li>Have lots of fun!</li>
