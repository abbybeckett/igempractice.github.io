         <h1>Native PAGE</h1>
         <p>A native PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was chosen to verify that our complementary sequences were forming the probe and  to demonstrate  that our miDNA can bind to the probe. We used a 12 percentage gel, and the polyacrylamide solution used was in a 1:19 ratio of acrylamide to bisacrylamide. The 12 percentage gel was able to distinguish a 22 nucleotide difference in the sample. 

         <br><br> The native PAGE ensures that the base pairing between the complementary strands remains intact during the electrophoresis, which is required to verify the formation of our probe. The experiment was performed using standard SDS PAGE equipment, but a longer gel is ideal.

          <h3>We conducted two experiments for the characterization of our carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles.</h3>
          <br>

          <h2>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)</h2>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>The zeta potential analyzer is used to find if the nanoparticles were evenly distributed in the solution and to confirm the presence of stable carboxylic acid groups. This system is designed for the characterization of colloidal, nanoparticulate, and macromolecular samples. It can determine the zeta potential, which is a measure of the electrostatic potential that exists at the interface between a particle and the surrounding liquid or dispersion medium.

          </p>
          <p>The instrument works on the basis of Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). It will detect the fluctuation in the intensity of scattered light over a time period, which is caused by the Brownian movement of particles and can calculate the zeta potential with this reading.
          </p>
        <p>The experiment requires the samples to be diluted and loaded into a cuvette
      </p><p>The cuvette should be filled with around 500 microlitres of the aqueous solution of the particle. The cuvette must be carefully placed into the slot in the machine and the experiment can be run.
          
      </p><p>A singular peak in the resulting graph would mean that the particles are well dispersed in the medium and a zeta potential value, lower than -20 mV
           will indicate that there are stable carboxyl groups present in the solution. This negative charge is formed because the carboxyl groups will lose a proton and become negatively charged when present in aqueous solution
          </p>

          <h2>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)</h2>
          <p> To obtain high-resolution images of our nanoparticles for size determination, we conducted Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies. TEM is a microscopy technique that works by transmitting a beam of electrons through a thin specimen and capturing the transmitted electrons to create high-resolution images. The sample must be loaded on a copper grid and air-dried to remove all the excess water. This sample can be stored in a microcentrifuge tube at room temperature if needed.

          <h2>Formation of nanoprobe</h2>
          <p>The binding of the probe to the carboxylated magnetic nanoparticle</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Our probe structure was divided into three different single-stranded DNA oligos, that would bind together by complementarity, to form the working probe. These three sequences were named A, B and C. Out of these structures, B contains an NH2 group that could be bound to the carboxyl (COOH) group present in the nanoparticle by an amide bond formed by EDC coupling reaction.
           </p> 
            <p>This involves washing the nanoparticles with MES to prevent agglomeration, followed by treatment with EDC, which activates the carboxyl groups present in the nanoparticles. These activated carboxyl groups can now form an amide bond with sequence B. So, the required volume of sequence B is added to the activated carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles and incubated overnight at room temperature with constant shaking. After this step, the supernatant is removed and the required volume of sequences A and C are added and incubated for 1 hour. Now, The supernatant can be removed after pulling the particles down using a magnet and fresh medium can be added.
            </p> 
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>The cross-linkage will help to have a lower detection limit for the system. 

             </li>
             <li>Compared to the unattached state, there will be more probes present in a unit volume in this attached system.
            </li>
            <li>Removing the supernatant after pulling the nanoprobes down using a magnet will help to remove excess unbound strands that have fluorophores attached. This is important to reduce the background noise and give better output.
            </li>
            <li>
              These nanoprobes, after being dispersed in a media can be collected to one point using a magnet, which can help to concentrate the fluorescence to one region instead of being spread across the sample. This can also help to separate the nanoprobes from other particles that may be present in the sample that can physically block the fluorescence.
            </li>
           </ul>

          <h2>FLUORESCENCE-BASED EXPERIMENTS USING MICROPLATE READER</h2>
          <p>All the experiments mentioned below were performed on a Costar, black, flat-bottom plate.
          </p>
          <p>The readout was taken by performing an emission scan, with a constant excitation of 490 nm and emission range of 500 to 600 nm, with readings taken in 1 nm steps.

          </p>
          
          <l>
           <li>Fluorescence intensity change on adding the miDNA to the probe, before binding the probe to the nanoparticle
            </li>
            <p>We conducted this experiment to see if the binding was indeed giving us a fluorescence change.
              The results from this experiment could be used as a comparison to show the effect of binding the probes to the nanoparticle
              </p>
            <li>Fluorescence intensity change on adding the miDNA to the Nanoprobe (after attachment)
              <p>This was performed to see if there was a considerable increase in fluorescence in the nanoprobe after miDNA was added. In the experiment, the amount of probe and total volume was kept constant. The control had an equal volume of the medium used for dilution of the miDNA as the volume of the miDNA sample.</p>
            
            </li>
            <li>Finding the detection limit of the nanoprobe
              <br>
              <p>This experiment was performed to see if our probes would be able to give a change in fluorescence intensity even at low levels of miDNA as the miRNA levels in the blood are in picomolar levels. We tested as low as  10 picomolar concentrations of miDNA. The volume of the probe and sample was kept constant and the concentration of the sample was varied.</p>

          <h2>Confirmation</h2>
          <p>This is done using alkaline lysis. Alkaline Lysis to separate plasmid DNA from all other cell constituents including genomic DNA.
            <br>
            Working Principle:
          </p><p>
          </p><ul>
           <li>The cell pellets are resuspended in a buffer, usually EDTA or Tris. The cells are lysed using an alkali, like 10 N NaOH and a detergent 
             like SDS that denatures most of the cell proteins. 
            </li>
            <li>The cell debris is then precipitated using potassium acetate that helps renature the double stranded plasmid DNA. This is then 
              dissolved and the dissolved DNA is eluted out after centrifuging. 
            </li>
            <li>We now need to precipitate the DNA and clean it of the salts it was dissolved in. An ethanol/isopropanol extraction method precipitates 
              the final plasmid DNA. 
            </li>
            <li>A miniprep kit works on the same principle.</li>
            <li>Elute in low volumes, typically lower than the instruction manual gives, around 30uL in two rounds of 15uL each. Heat the elution 
              buffer or NFW beforehand, and let it soak the membrane for 5-10 minutes before you spin it down.
            </li>
          </ul>
