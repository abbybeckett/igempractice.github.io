    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.</p>
    <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #2 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize with this page.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.
    <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Science and Synthetic Biology has always had a mixed reception from the public, with some viewing it as a brilliant strategy to combat 
          real-world problems and improve human life while others are mistrustful of the threats and dangers it can pose. In order to design a good 
          solution to any problem, one must have a good idea of what those affected by the problem and, therefore, the solution needed. It is 
          important to have <b> a people-centered approach </b> and to actively seek their input at every stage of your project. It is vital to 
          understand their perspective and how your solution should cater to their needs. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our integrated Human Practices is a story of our journey through <b> understanding and identifying the problem </b>, coming up with a 
          <b> suitable solution </b>, and continuously <b>modifying our solution based on the inputs we have received</b>, ensuring that our 
          project can move <b>beyond being just a laboratory concept</b> into a real-world therapeutic. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-card">
        <h1>Highlights</h1>
        <p>A summary of our main findings and how they influenced our project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          We researched extensively about <b>Dengue in the news, from papers, on the World Health Organisation site, and from our friends, families,
          academicians, and virologists</b>. We obtained a thorough understanding of the problem in terms of the disease pathology and how it can
          be stopped effectively. We spoke with the <b>local municipal bodies</b> in India - PMC and BBMP, to obtain a case-wise distribution and
          breakup in terms of age, gender, areas prone. We also spoke to a <b>Dengue virologist</b> who routinely interacts and is actively
          involved in spreading awareness about dengue, <b>Dr Maulori Curio Cabral, from Brazil</b> to get a deeper understanding of the situation
          in a different country and social context than ours. 
          </li>
          <li>
           We learned that <b>Dengue has no true cure</b>, and interactions with <b>several doctors</b> in the field made us aware that the current
           treatment for Dengue is aimed at <b>symptom control</b> which is sufficient for a primary infection. However, most primary infections
           are undiagnosed which could lead to a <b>worse secondary infection</b> masquerading as a primary infection. Therefore, our therapeutic
           needs to be equally effective against both primary as well as secondary infections. 
  
          </li>
          <li>
           Our initial project idea involved the production of IgY-IgG hybrid antibodies to target the NS1 antigen. However, <b>based on inputs
           received from several experts</b>, as outlined below, we <b>modified our project</b> to now be the production of scFvs with an
           engineered FcRn binding peptide to increase half-life to target the E dimer Epitope.
          </li>
          <li>
            We sought to <b>quantify the public awareness of Dengue</b> through an informative survey. The point of the survey was to gauge the
            general knowledge about Dengue and simultaneously help spread awareness. 
  
          </li>
          <li>
           Since our project involved working with the Dengue virus, which is a <b>risk group 2 organism</b> and our epitopes contribute toward
           increasing the virulence of the organism, we looked into alternatives for conducting our assay and decided on using VLPs based on the
           suggestion of Dr Rahul Roy.
  
          </li>
          <li>
           We also conducted a webinar in collaboration with MIT_MAHE on <b>Biosafety and Ethics</b> and interacted with the speaker <b>Dr Vinod
           Jyothikumar</b>, regarding the possible safety concerns our project could have and alternative production methods.
          </li>
          <li>
           We spoke to <b>several people from varying socio-economic backgrounds</b> and sought to learn how dengue has affected them and to spread
           awareness about vector control measures.

              <ul>

                <li>They also went on to explain to us that the sequence he had sent did not consist of a leader sequence and that a leader sequence which is also known as a signal peptide sequence starting with MET should be added if we wished to express and secrete our antibody in the bacterial system. </li>
                <li>They added that any antibody sequence to be expressed in a vector should have a Leader sequence - Variable light or heavy chain sequence - Constant light or heavy chain sequence.</li>

              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                We initially approached him to learn of the possible immune response of our body toward an avian antibody. Since then we have approached him several times to seek his input regarding scFvs, their clearance from the body, possible ways to reduce immunogenicity and therapeutic delivery methods.
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Prof Rath warned us against a possible immune response and said that we would have to be very careful in that aspect since our dosage might also have to vary depending on the disease progression which could lead to toxicity.</li>
                <li>He advised against deimmunisation via T-cell epitope mapping and mutations since it might destabilize the antibody and compromise functionality. </li>
                <li>He told us that we were coming up with a much more expensive production method for IgYs than what already existed and cautioned us against going ahead with it since the cons outweighed the pros.</li>
                <li>He allayed our fears about lacking a possible clearance mechanism and told us that the body’s natural processes of pinocytosis, proteases and lysis should be enough.  </li>
                <li>He told us that there was no concrete evidence that the FcRn receptor is solely responsible for increasing the half-life, and that it may as well be that size plays an equally important role. He asked us to conduct a four-fold assay with scFv + FcRnBp, scFv dimers + FcRnBp, scFv dimers and scFv to analyse this. We were very interested in knowing how this assay pans out but were unable to run it owing to time constraints.</li>

              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>He said that the possible reason why IgY bound more efficiently could be due to its low-entropic energy as opposed to IgG which is floppy due to its hinge.  </li>

                <li>As for the mode of delivery, she told us that developments were in place for an oral prophylactic treatment of IgY for Covid-19 and that this form of treatment was feasible since IgY can get absorbed through the digestive tract.

              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>She recommended producing full-length antibodies in SHuffle before moving onto fragments as a test of functionality, which we did. </li>
                <li>She told us that most animal house facilities rarely have chickens since they can only be used for producing IgY. This means that chickens are disassociated from science and bacterial systems could provide a modular and cheap method of producing any antibodies. </li>

              <ul>
                <li>Dr Rao and Dr Jog emphasized on the lack of knowledge and information about healthcare in the rural parts of India. </li>
                <li>Since Dengue can be passed on from mothers to unborn fetuses in pregnant individuals, we asked Dr Rao about the number of such cases and measures taken in such situations. Dr Rao and Dr Jog stressed that most of such cases go unnoticed because of lack of awareness and diagnostic facilities.
                    She highlighted that there should be awareness campaigns and spread of information to the masses to explain Dengue precautions and treatment.

              <ul>
                <li>We learned about the right antibody to choose to produce - 
                    It has to be proven to work with several studies
                    It needs to have some utility, which in this case would be to neutralise Dengue and not cause ADE.
                </li>
                <li>He advised us to go for a serotype-specific antibody like the one against DENV-2. However, we chose not to do this since our entire project is based on avoiding sequences specific to one virus and instead opted for a conserved sequence. </li>

                We approached Dr Prasad to learn more about the structural aspects of the virus and sought to improve upon our choice of an epitope.
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>She suggested, and we accepted after a literature review, to opt for the E dimer Epitope which exists in the pre-mature to mature stage of the virus. Since the breathability of this dimer structure to form a trimer and allow the Fusion loop to establish contact with the host cell is crucial for viral entry, hindering this would aid in decreasing the viral load in the body. </li>
                <li>She also suggested that we choose the C-10 class of antibodies which had been isolated from humans that targetted the EDE. </li>
                <li>She told us that the envelope protein could be induced to dimerize in the solution. </li>
                <li>She advised against using Anti-NS1 antibodies since it requires a certain threshold viral load to produce NS1 proteins. </li>
                <li>She also told us that Anti-NS1 antibodies are found to destroy epithelial cells, which could contribute to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, and that they cross-react with host proteins.
                    She advised against going for the fusion loop epitope, which was our then plan since apparently exposure of the epitope varies according to the serotype.
                    She told us that dosage calculations have to be experimental and that any model or formula could lead to over or under estimations.

When he heard that we planned on inducing dimerisation of Envelope protein in solution, he disagreed with us and said that the E protein tends to not dimerise or fold properly in the absence of the pRM protein.

                WHY:<br/>
                Following Dr Gore’s suggestions and our own readings, we decided upon working with scFvs with an engineered binding peptide to increase half-life and we had several questions regarding the functionality of these modified scFvs. To have some of these questions answered, we reached out to Dr Sirk who is the person that helped engineer these binding peptides onto scFvs for breast cancer. 
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>She said that the orientation of the scFvs either in VL-VH or VH-VL does not matter since most scFvs work in both directions. However, she did say that they experienced certain problems with expression and binding to FcRn in certain variants which might have been solved by using the reverse orientation (they had used the VL-VH orientation.
                    She told us that their engineered fragments are predicted to persist for several days, and hopefully weeks.
                </li>
                <li>She also told us that these binding peptides did not seem to be interfering with the antigen binding affinity and that the case was the same for all variants including unmodified fragments which came as a relief for us. 
                    She also asked us to reach out to Mr Vince Kelly, who was the primary author on the paper.

              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>He informed us that in their study not all variants (including N terminal peptides) could be generated due to time and resource constraints (we surpassed that by using haddock correctly)
                    He advised us against expressing and purifying our own FcRn is very difficult, try to do it on cell lines
                </li>
                <li>He told us that the orientation (VH-VL or VL-VH) probably doesn't matter too much in agreement with Dr Sirk.He added that the double peptide variant was to mimic the homodimeric nature of IgG
                    We wanted to know if the cyclic or linearised version of the peptide was better to which he said that the cyclic mutation plays a structural stability role
                </li>
                <li>He also said that the Y12H mutation plays a role in enhanced pH dependent binding due to histidine being more active at low pH in the endosome and was essential for proper functionality. 
                    He proposed that one of the directions to take this forward is to engineer bacteria and release them into the gut such that they produce these scfv-fcrnbps when needed.
                    He was happy with our project taking the initially engineered fragment beyond cancer into Dengue therapeutics.

               WHO:<br/>
               We visited a vasti near our campus to gain their perspective on Dengue. A vasti is the local term for a slum-like area consisting of people living in very poor conditions. 
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                People living in slums, in closed and cramped quarters in poor living conditions are the most hard-hit demographic by Dengue. It is crucial to understand the extent of the problem and how best to cater to their needs. 
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <p>
                When we first walked into their vasti which was just off the main road, we saw that the entire place was filled with water from the recent rains. In fact a few days back some of our team members saw that the heavy rains had forced most of the people away from the settlement due water logging. We saw people standing on the road with their belongings on their heads, which prompted us to visit to learn more. 
We learnt that during every rainy season, their surroundings turn into swamps from where begins the uncontrollable problem of mosquitoes and other insects. We learnt that their toilets get flooded and their water supply gets contaminated. We also learnt of their reluctance to go to a clinic and seek medical help despite serious illnesses. Our conversations led us to the conclusion that the majority of our consumers would be ignorant, from low economic backgrounds, reluctant to seek medical attention and get tested. Therefore, our solution and efforts needed to cater to all these points. <br/><br/>

              <p>
               WHO:<br/>
               Dr Sancheti is an Assistant Professor in the department of Humanities and the Social Sciences at IISER, Pune. Her research interests include Postmodernist fiction, Magical Realism, Myth, English Language Teaching, Narrative Theories, Art & Aesthetics.  She is actively involved in several outreach activities and during the pandemic, with the help of Dr Nadkarni, Dr Rajamani and several others, started the Milk and Eggs program for the vasti children to ensure that they received adequate nutrition. They also supplied basic rations to the vasti residents during that period.  
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                We sought the help of Dr Sancheti to learn how to conduct effective human practises and outreach and for her input on our survey. 
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>We had a series of meetings with Dr Sancheti and from the very beginning she emphasised upon the importance of having an accessible and informative approach. 
                    She asked us how our outreach and efforts at educating the public be any different than reading something in the news, and stressed the importance of having a good approach.
                </li>
                <li>She also advised us to talk to the adults, in most demographics, about spreading efforts and education so that they can go ahead and educate their children. 
                    With reference to our survey, she said the simpler and easier it is to understand the better reception we would get. She also wanted us to gauge the variation of awareness amongst those from a tropical country vs those from non-tropical countries. We made edits to our survey based on her suggestions.

               WHO:<br/>
               Dr Rahul Roy is a Dengue virologist at IISC, Bangalore. He has worked extensively with the DENV2 serotype and has recently published a paper that characterizes the incidences of the various strains and serotypes of DENV throughout India.
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                We approached him regarding acquiring the E dimer Epitope and for inputs on our project. 
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>We had an offline meeting with him at his institute, where we spoke at length about our project. 
                    He approved of our choice of epitope and said that quaternary epitopes are the best. 
                    He went on to tell us that he had just recently finished writing a paper on the distribution of Dengue serotypes in India.
                </li>
                <li>He suggested that we use a Dengue VLP when we were looking for an alternative to a whole virus to express our protein and very kindly offered to give us the plasmid. He went on to offer to produce the VLPs himself and help us run our assays at his institute. Debayani Chakraborty, from his lab, gave us her time and helped us perform a successful assay. 
                    For proof of concept, he suggested that we do a Fusion-quenching assay to check the neutralization of the virus. He also offered to perform the same at his institute. 
                    He sent us the manuscript of the paper that he published recently on Dengue Serotype distribution in India.

               WHO:<br/>
               The MIT_MAHE iGEM team aim to improve coastal aquaculture operations through a novel peptide by targeting Vibrio parahaemolyticus. It is one of the most prevalent bacteria involved in spreading the Vibriosis disease in fish. Our approach involves targeting Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7—i.e., MAM7—an adhesion protein which helps the bacteria to hold onto the host cells. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We collaborated with MIT_MAHE  on multiple accounts - dry lab, wet lab, Integrated Human Practises and Outreach. 
                On the iHP and Outreach front, MIT_MAHE reached out to to doctors, on our behalf, from the Infectious Disease Department in a government medical college located in Kerala, India and spoke with Dr. Veeresh Kumar, MBBS MD, Arun Clinic, Guntakal, Anantapur, located in Andhra Pradesh, India managed to obtain data regarding the daily cases, hospital measures taken to treat patients, and their opinion on the government initiatives taken.<br/> We also conducted a webinar on Biosafety and Ethics in collaboration with them and invited Dr Vinod Jyothikumar, a consultant at DSS+ to share his inputs.

            <h1>BBMP AND PMC: </h1>
            <div>
              <p>
               WHO:<br/>
               The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Pune Municipal Corporation are local governing bodies in Bangalore and Pune respectively. We spoke to Dr Madhusudan and Shri. Sanjiv Vavare from the two bodies. 
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                We wished to understand the case-wise distribution of Dengue in areas close to us and know of the measures undertaken by the governments to prevent the spread of dengue. Knowing the patterns of spread and the measures already undertaken would help us understand the scope of our project better and fill the gaps in communication with our outreach. 
              </p>
              <p>At the PMC, we met Shri. Sanjeev Wavare from the Health Department. He spoke of the general trend seen in Pune over the years and said that due to the intermittent rains that cause an increase in stagnant water-filled years which in turn see a rise in the incidences of Dengue during the months of July-October. He was of the opinion that during covid, the number of cases went down since people weren’t in closed spaces as much and added that it could also be due to Aedes primarily being a day-biter. He also made it a point to mention that the prevention of the spread of Dengue is entirely dependent on public participation and that their main control measures were holding rallies, society meetings for vector control, demonstrations and distributing pamphlets.  
                July and October tend to have the most Dengue cases. He mentioned that 2014 saw the highest no. of cases due to intermittent rains. This caused a lot of transfusion shortage. He mentioned that around 70 percent of the cases were Normal Dengue cases, 20 percent had Dengue Haemorrhagic fever while 10 percent got Dengue Shock syndrome. 
                We also asked Dr Wavare about the measures taken after people are diagnosed with Dengue. Fogging and spraying is done immediately by PMC workers at locations where the cases were diagnosed. He also mentioned chemical control using chemicals like Temephos, VTI liquid, larvicides, and dichlorobenzene. 
                At the BBMP, we met Dr Madhusudan from the Health Department. He gave us extensive data on the ward-wise cases of dengue in the last few years and commented on the decrease in cases seen over the last couple of years and agreed that it might be due to the pandemic.

               WHO:<br/>
               Santosh Kadam is 34 years old and has been working as a helper at our institute for 10 years. He has only been educated till 8th grade but has picked up skills of operating the autoclave and protocols of decontamination and discard of waste biological materials.
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                These workers are typically from marginalized communities from rural areas. He counts as an important stakeholder in our quest for a therapeutic for Dengue. 
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: <br/>
                He talked about another neglected disease prevalent in his hometown of Nanded, in Hingoli district of our state of Maharashtra - Chikungunya. He spoke about his observations of people having extreme joint pain that they couldn’t walk or stand.
He talked at length about the low levels of medical care in the village, and their dependence on homemade remedies. Sometimes visiting doctors would come to his village and administer shots, but there weren’t any established well-educated doctors in residence there.
When we asked him about how a therapeutic for Dengue fever could be received in his community, he brought about the point of awareness. He drew parallels with the low COVID vaccination rates in his village and erroneous beliefs like how COVID would vanish because of the high heat in the summer. We felt this was a point we overlooked. Once our drug eventually comes to market, it should be received well, given it works. 
We also had other discussions about the relevance of scientific research for the common man in India, about the education system in India and how it differs in urban and rural areas. He also said that he is employed because students like us work at the institute. If we don’t study – people like him don’t have a job.

               Dr Cabral is a Professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He also teaches healthcare workers about various disease pathologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                We met with Dr Cabral through our friends in the iGEM USP Brazil team. Our friends from the team were incredibly helpful and acted as translators. We met with Dr Cabral to understand the ground reality of Dengue cases in Brazil and about the measures in place there to curb the spread of the disease.
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dr Cabral answered our questions incredibly patiently in a meeting that stretched over 6 hours. We spoke at length about the viral pathology and infection and the mechanisms by which antibodies bring down the viral load. 
                    He stressed upon the importance of avidity over affinity and asked us to dimerise our scFvs to achieve stronger complexes, which we will be doing in the future. 
                    He also went on to answer our questions about the distributions of cases in Brazil.
                </li>
                <li>From his extensive experience, he said that generally children aged around 8 years are the most susceptible to the disease. He did not elaborate on the why. 
                    He spoke of setting up ovitraps to arrest mosquito eggs and determine the species it belongs to and explained that Ovitraps are sticky, adhesive membranes that collect eggs and arrest them when it is deposited on to the membrane by the female mosquito. 
                </li>
                <li>He spoke of the pandemic and said that there hasn’t been an extensive formal survey yet into the number of people infected with both Dengue and COVID, which could also be due to how the vast majority of resources were diverted to treating COVID which inadvertently cost the medical system and contributed to an increase in the incidences of other diseases. Additionally, people with Dengue were apparently scared to go to the hospital to get treated during the pandemic, and instead self-diagnosed and self-medicated. </li>
                <li>He touched upon the methods to prevent vector spread and said that stagnant water should not be left untouched for more than a week and should be cleared out. He also said that mosquitoes can arrest themselves in the larval stage and can survive like that for upto 5 years. 
                    He stressed that one should target vector control measures at all four stages of the Dengue lifecycle.

Her research interests lie in the fields of novel nanocarriers for cosmeceuticals and other pertinent areas of national relevance with major emphasis on malaria, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. She has worked extensively on drug delivery systems. 
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                We approached her to learn more about the pharmaceutical industry, the relevance of our therapeutic and possible drug delivery systems that we could employ. 
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>She said that the most important thing to consider before going for downstream processing and further trials is if our molecule is functional and stable at pH 7.4 
                    Is it stable at all pH levels? How do the different environments in our body affect the conformation and stability of the fragment? Are there any peptidases, natural or otherwise, that can change the peptide linker of our fragment? Are there any peptidases that can change our fragment itself? If so, which environments are they present in? What are the effects of different ions? Can our protein pass through the digestive tract? If so, at which points?
                    Once we have these questions ironed out, we can consider going for different delivery methods based on the behavior of our antibody fragment in different environments. 
                    She suggested that our current fragment could be encapsulated, perhaps a lipidic capsulation like PEG. 
                </li>
                <li>She said we could also go for a IV administration of our drug. 
                    She suggested that we do extensive downstream processing for endotoxins since we are producing it in a bacterial system.
                    We will definitely try to incorporate all of her suggestions in the future development of our project. 
                    She also suggested that we spoke to Dr Nishikant Subedhar who is a professor at our institute.

                WHY:<br/>
                We met with Dr Kamat multiple times. A couple during the early ideation phase of our project to get his opinions on it and then once further along in the cycle.
We were looking into assays to perform as a proof of concept. We wanted to perform an endocytosis assay as a proof for extension of half-life, and since Dr Kamat’s lab works extensively on similar assays we approached him to learn more. 
              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <p>We explained our need to conduct a transcytosis assay and asked him about the ways in which we could account for the differential binding owing to changes in pH. 
                Additionally, he suggested that we look into conducting assays that can test for proper protein folding and suggested that we do a SYPRO-Orange assay.

              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dr Patel, in great detail, explained to us as to what makes Dengue a severe and unique problem in India. 

                </li>
                <li>He said that during the 2017 outbreak in India, there were about 80-90 cases daily which were poorly documented and that they faced an acute shortage of beds. He said that this was a common scenario in tertiary centers.
                </li>

                <li>He went on to say that most dengue cases occur around construction sites, since these sites involve multiple people working in close proximity, living in unsanitary conditions with plenty of spaces for water collection which prompted us to talk to several of these construction workers.
                </li>

                <li>He also told us that during the pandemic, since most construction activities were stopped, there was a dip in cases but then that could have also been due to people mistaking dengue for covid. 
                </li>
                <li>He explained that there are 3 phases to the disease - the febrile, critical and recovery phase. These phases are highly important and should be characterized well since the type of fluid treatment depends on these phases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He added that this is where the problem lies - 
                     <ol type ="1.">
                       <li>Patients don’t come to the hospital until the situation is serious. Fever is taken lightly, and patients leave on an
                          OPD basis.</li>
                       <li>linicians can’t identify the stage of dengue. Identification of the critical phase is important to give the
                          appropriate fluid dose.</li>
                       <li>There is a manpower shortage at times in a tertiary centre.</li>
                       </ol>
                   <li>He also suggested that we go for an IV mode of delivery since it is easier in a government hospital set-up and also has accountability. </li>

                WHY:<br/>
                We spoke to Dr Raghunathan to gain her perspective on our project and how it could be improved to be viable in a real world scenario. We also wanted to learn more about the problem from her point of view.

              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>She spoke to us of the current treatment methods for Dengue and said that it was primarily a combination of fluids - colloids, blood and plasma. She said that the fluid constitution varies as per the severity of dengue. 
                    She told us that the confusion with Dengue being mistaken for covid was prevalent predominantly in the first wave of the pandemic and that they were very lucky not to have had any deaths in the paediatric ward. 
                </li>
                <li>She said that in her opinion, the severity of dengue is higher amongst adolescents than children cause they tend not to keep track of the fluids they are consuming. 
                    She stressed that our therapeutic could only be used during the initial disease stages which could be problematic since most individuals get tested only when the disease progresses to severe symptoms. This is a shortcoming that we are hoping to resolve.

              <ul>
                <li>Dr Jain approved our choice of chassis, and said that eukaryotic cells and cell lines are hard to maintain and have a high production cost. If we are planning to scale this up to industrial grade then we would have to keep our cost to a minimum since our primary consumers would be people from poor economic backgrounds. </li>
                <li>He also said that aglycosylated antibodies would be better for functionality which would be compromised in an eukaryotic system. 
                    He also said that cost of production would depend on the dosage but that we have no way of determining the dosage without conducting trials.

            <div>
              <p>
                Our conversations with the people around us, who made up a huge component of our stakeholders, showed that the majority of the people were unaware about Dengue or worse had superstitions and flawed perceptions about the disease, doctors and medicine in general. In a bid to tackle this problem, we decided to come up with an informative survey that would serve the dual purpose of understanding the distribution of awareness about Dengue and dispense information regarding the disease, its pathology, prevention methods and current treatment. In order to make our survey more effective, we took the help of <b>Dr Pooja Sancheti, who is an Assistant Professor</b> in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences at IISER, Pune. She asked us to put ourselves in the shoes of our survey takers and analyse the kind of questions they would or would not prefer to answer. She suggested that we should ask if our survey taker was from a tropical or non-tropical country since that might affect their level of knowledge, which we incorporated into our survey.
Additionally, in order to make our survey more accessible, we translated it into the main regional languages of Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi and Hindi.

                    He said that the problem should be reduced down to a question, and more importantly to a yes or no question. 
                    There should be a clear-cut decision maker known and respected by all.
                </li>

              </p>
              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <p>Several members of our team spoke to workers living and working in various locations. 
                One of the locations was in a flood-prone area close to a team member’s home. She found upon interacting with them that owing to the recent rains, they have had to bar the doors of their temporary homes with their utensils and have taken to sleeping in the building that they are constructing which is extremely dangerous. Her society worked together to build a temporary shelter in a basketball court. 
                Our conversations with the BBMP workers made us aware about one of the measures taken to prevent the spread of Dengue. She said that after the rains, they let the potholes dry up and clean the area around it and that the drains are cleaned regularly. 
                Our interactions with the traffic police also yielded similar conclusions. One of the police we were talking was shocked to find out that Dengue has no cure and asked about using Papaya leaf extracts to treat Dengue. They also expressed agreement that lack of awareness was a major problem in tackling fear and mistrust of clinics and medicines. 
                Most of the public that we spoke to were extremely reluctant and mistrustful of us clicking their pictures. They were terrified that they would get into trouble even after repeated assurance that the photos would not be misused by us.

              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dr Tripathi suggested that we look into antibody cocktails to improve chances of binding. However, after a literature study and talking to multiple other experts, we decided against following his advice since an antibody cocktail targeting multiple epitopes could increase the chances of non-neutralising binding. 
                    He also suggested that we look into the conserved epitopes within the pRM and E protein as that could help with neutralizing binding.
                </li>
                <li>He suggested that we work with F(ab)s instead of full-length antibodies since we could give it orally as F(ab)s can pass through the mucosa-blood barrier. We modified his suggestion and instead decided on scFvs.
                    He also suggested that we look into mutation rates of the DENV virus since that would determine the efficacy of our antibodies. We reached out to Dr Rahul Roy to obtain data for the same.

                <li>Dr Nagalkar spoke of the shortcomings of the current vaccine for Dengue - DENGVAXIA like its low efficacy in children and in Dengue-naive individuals. He also touched upon the fact that it can lead to a more severe Dengue fever if infected post-vaccination.
                </li>
                <li>He explained the various problems that exist in vaccine development for Dengue like</li>
                <li>- Existence of multiple serotypes and their unpredictable distribution<br/>
                    - gap in understanding the viral pathogenesis<br/>
                    - lack of a reliable animal model<br/>
                    - complexity of host immunological mechanisms<br/>
                    and the ways to overcome them.</li>

                <li>Dr Nagalkar also explained the different strategies to design a vaccine -</li> 
                    <li>- live attenuated vaccine<br/> 
                        - inactivated virus vaccine <br/>
                        - recombinant subunit vaccine <br/>
                        - viral-vector vaccine<br/>
                        - DNA vaccine</li>

            <h1>Dr Mehmet Berkmen:</h1>
            <div>
              <p>
               WHO:<br/>
               Dr Berkmen, is a bacterial geneticist at New England Biolabs (NEB), Boston, Massachusetts. He is one of the inventors of SHuffle (our chassis) and was the first to produce full-length aglycosylated IgG antibody via the system. He is also our secondary PI.   
              </p>
              <p>
                WHY:<br/>
                When we were finalising our choice of production, we approached him to gain a deeper insight into the workings of SHuffle and its efficacy in production. 
                </p>


              <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>He was enthused about working with us and patiently answered all of our questions about SHuffle.
                </li>
                <li>We have had regular meetings with him where we have updated him about our progress. </li>
                <li>He helped us create our plasmid construct and provided various suggestions on how to make it more modular.</li>

                <li>He taught us the necessary details about coming up with a good iGEM project and gave is several inputs on bettering our idea, our pitch and our presentation. </li> 
                    <li>He advised us not to spend clean thoughts on dirty data when we were struggling to purify our antibodies correctly. </li>

          <h1>Coming up with a Solution</h1>
          <p>
            What makes a good therapeutic? - is a question that we asked ourselves
            and our stakeholders over the course of our project. After talking to
            our stakeholders, we identified the hallmarks of a good therapeutic.
          </p>
          <h2>An ideal therapeutic for Dengue should:</h2>
          <br/>
          <div class="pd-img-container"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4429/wiki/ihp/ihp/human-prac/plan-2-page-0001.jpg"/> 
        </div>
           <br/>
          
          <p>
            Incorporating these properties into our solution would enable it to be a viable option for the treatment of Dengue.<br/>
            Over the course of our project, <b>we’ve done our best to meet the above requirements</b> and have constantly edited our project to fit
            into our vision of an ideal therapeutic.<br/>
            However, we have been constrained by the nature of our solution in certain areas like having a low cost of production. Using a bacterial
            system for the production of our antibodies is probably more expensive than the traditional method of immunizing animals and extracting
            antibodies from them. However, we <b>prioritised using a safe, ethical and modular method</b> over having a low cost of production. Even
            so, our
            current method of using a bacterial chassis is relatively cheaper and easier than using eukaryotic cells, as outlined in detail below.
            <br/>
            Additionally, we have also prioritised having a therapeutic that causes minimal immunogenic response over a minimally invasive mode of
            drug delivery as outlined in detail below. 
    
    
          </p>
          <p>
            When we first sat down to think of a solution, an obvious direction for us was to find a molecule that would render the virus inactive
            but not bind with the Fc receptors. After a literature study, we hit upon the <b>avian class of antibodies - IgY</b>, which checked all
            of our requirements. Being a non-mammalian antibody, it is incompatible with the mammalian Fc receptor and they could be engineered to
            bind and neutralize dengue virus or any virus with multiple virulent serotypes, for that matter, as long as we had the sequence.<br/>
            <br/>
    
    
           We faced our first roadblock with acquiring the sequence and realized that the 3D structure of IgY had not yet been publicly resolved.
           With the help of <b>Dr David Bradley and Juho Choi, IgY researchers</b>, who sent us the sequence of the constant region, we put together
           the construct of an IgY-IgG hybrid with the constant region of IgY and the variable region of IgG and even resolved a 3D image of it. As a
           placeholder, our hybrid antibody was targeting the Maltose Binding Protein. We were extremely lucky to have had in-depth discussions with
           <b>Dr Alexander I Taylor, who had worked extensively with IgYs before and our secondary PI Dr Mehmet Berkmen, a bacterial geneticist from
            NEB</b>, regarding the properties of IgY. Dr Taylor advised against using an IV mode of drug delivery and warned us about the <b>possible
            immunogenic response</b> that could result from exposing our body to avian antibodies. We also had multiple discussions with <b>Dr
            Satyajit Rath and Dr Vineeta Bal, who are both immunologists at our institution</b>, regarding the possible immune response of our body
            against
            IgY and what we could do to circumvent it. While the prospect of <b>deimmunisation by removing the T-cell epitopes</b> on our construct
            was
            considered, the risk of inadvertently destabilizing the structure and thereby compromising the efficacy of our antibody was too much. Dr
            Rath also told us that our IgY-IgG construct was simply a <b>very high-tech solution to a very low-tech industry</b>. We also learnt from
            <b>Dr Supriya Kashikar, the founder of Genext Genomics</b>, who told us that the half-life of IgYs in the body would be low since it
            cannot bind to the FcRn receptor in our body and therefore cannot be recycled. Further, <b>Dr Gavin Screaton, an Immunologist at the
            University of Oxford</b>, advised us <b>not to continue with IgY</b> and instead opt for an alternative.<br/>
            <br/>
    
            We wanted our drug to offer a solution to ADE, to effectively neutralise the disease, for the virus-antibody complex to be cycled out of
            our body with a minimal immune reaction from our body, and for the dosage levels to be non-toxic. Since our solution did not check all of
            these boxes, we decided to shift away from it. This came as a setback for us, but we were determined to have a realistic, simple, and
            effective solution for ADE and a good drug. Following advice given by Dr Screaton and Dr Rath, we looked into the functionality of Fc
            mutated IgGs and aglycosylated IgGs - it had all the advantages of using IgY with the added benefit of not causing an immunogenic
            response. However, circling back to Dr Kashikar’s warning and our subsequent literature review<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2018.01.006"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, Fc mutated antibodies would still have
            meant that its half-life in our body would be low and the cost of use high.<br/>
            <br/>
            <b>In a bid to improve affordability and to simplify our solution further, we landed on single chain fragment variable (scFv).</b>
            <br/>
            <br/> 
            ScFvs are <b>small</b> and have no constant regions (and thereby no effector functions). Their size makes them <b>cost effective and
            efficient</b>. However their half-life in the human body is quite low. To solve this problem, we decided to insert a peptide extension to
            the scFv that would increase its half-life by binding to the FcRn receptor. We decided to call this structure <b>NeoFvs</b>. We were very
            fortunate in successfully reaching out to <b>Dr Shannon Sirk and Mr Vince Kelly, who have both worked extensively with scFvs before</b>,
            to gain their inputs on working with scFvs with the FcRn binding peptide for dengue. Mr Kelly informed us that they were unable to
            generate all the variants with the binding peptide in different regions of the scFv due to time constraints and resources and asked us to
            look into it. We tried to surpass this by using HADDOCK simulations. He even <b>suggested a possible future implementation</b> to
            engineer bacteria and release them into the gut such that they produce these NeoFvs when needed. He commended us for taking forward their
            initial project of using these scFvs for breast cancer into viruses, calling it a true test of modularity.

           When we looked into the existing production methods for IgY, we found that the popular method was to <b>extract it from purified egg yolk
           by infecting chickens with the virus</b>. We felt that this method was <b>unethical</b>. Moreover, it had issues with
           batch standardisation and sustained production. It also generated polyclonal antibodies, which increase chances of cross-reactivity,
           leading to false positives and non-specific interactions with the antigen, which could be non-neutralising. <br/>
           <br/>
          We began looking for an alternative which ticked off our expectations for a good chassis and locked onto SHuffle. The SHuffle B strain
          derived from the E. coli B strain was a fit for most of our requirements. We reached out to <b>Dr Mehmet Berkmen, who works at New England
          Biolabs (NEB)</b> and was instrumental in the creation and development of the SHuffle strain of bacteria and was the first to produce
          full-length IgG antibodies with it. What started out as a zoom meeting ended up being a lengthy and fruitful relationship with him agreeing
          to be our secondary PI. He was delighted at the prospect of mentoring us and was incredibly helpful in ironing out the myriad questions we
          had regarding the culturing of SHuffle, production conditions and optimization.<br/>
          <br/>
    
    
          <b>Dr Raghavan Varadarajan, a biophysicist from IISc, Bangalore</b>, urged us to look into alternative production methods like standardized
          CHO cell lines and yeast systems when presented with our project. Following his advice, we did a thorough literature search and found that
          while CHO cells produce accurate complex proteins with high yields, they are expensive to culture and are slow growing (both points
          independently reiterated by <b>Dr Mugdha Gadgil, a CHO cell expert at NCL, Pune</b>, they can also have unwanted post-translational
          modifications like glycosylation.<br/> 
          Furthermore, <b>Dr Vinod Jyothikumar, a consultant for operational risk management at DSS+</b>, during a question and answer
          session after a webinar, pointed out that CHO cell lines do not retain stable protein expression over long-term culture and have a high
          cost of production. Additionally, <b>Dr Mayurika Lahiri, from our own institute</b>, told us that most animal house facilities don’t keep
          chickens
          since they are only used for producing IgY. This <b>traditional method of using chickens is removed from research and therefore our method
          of
          using a modular bacterial system could help promote further research into antibodies and antibody therapeutics</b>. 
          <br/>
          <br/> 
    
          A similar search regarding yeast systems and a conversation with <b>Dr Umesh Shaligram, director of R&D at the Serum Institute, India</b>
          (intoduced to us by the <b>GATES Foundation, India</b>), showed us that while it is widely used in recombinant protein production, they can
          mannosylate the antibody,  which could make it immunogenic. Bacteria lack the machinery for N-linked glycosylation, and cannot do the
          above. <b>Dr Ratnesh Jain, involved in recombinant protein production from ICT</b>, also advised against using eukaryotic cell lines since
          Dengue is primarily a tropical disease and requires the therapeutic to be affordable to all.

           Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family of viruses. It has 4 serotypes that can infect humans. India and Brazil have shown
           incidences of all four serotypes. <b>Choosing an appropriate epitope</b> that is equally conserved across all four serotypes, essential to
           the virulence of the virus and easily accessible was <b>crucial to overcome ADE</b> and neutralize the virus. After discussions with <b>Dr
           Nishad Matange, a bacterial geneticist at IISER Pune</b>, we looked into NS1 as a possible candidate based on his suggestions. NS1 protein
           is the only non-structural protein to be released extracellularly, which makes it an easy target for antibodies. Additionally, it is
           hypothesized to be crucial for the replication of the virus inside the host cells. 
    
          </p>
          <p>
            We then considered targeting the <b>Fusion Loop epitope</b>, which is essential for the virus to establish contact with the host cell and
            enter it. It is also highly conserved across serotypes. However, the FLE is partially hidden below EDI and ED-II and is exposed for a
            very short time, leading ot potential issues with accessibility. <b>Meetings with Dr Varadarajan Sundaramurthy and Dr Shashank Tripathi,
            both host-pathogen interaction experts from NCBS, Bangalore and IISc, Bangalore respectively</b>, yielded the same conclusion. They
            advised us to look into alternative epitopes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our conclusion was reached in a meeting with <b>Dr Vidya Mangala Prasad, a Dengue structural expert from IISc, Bangalore</b>. We
            presented the candidates we had in mind - NS1 protein, Fusion Loop epitope, EDI and ED-II to her and sought her inputs. <b>She suggested
            that we target the E dimer Epitope</b>, an epitope that is rarely targeted by the natural antibodies produced by our body, lessening
            competition with the therapeutic. It is also highly conserved across all four serotypes. Additionally, as EDE is present largely during
            the pre-mature stage, it will prevent binding and entry of the virus into the cell. She told us that the NS1 antibodies are only produced
            in greater concentrations after the viral load crosses a certain threshold and asked us to look into the C-10 class of antibodies, which
            had been isolated from human dengue patients. Following her suggestions, we did a thorough review of the literature on the E dimer
            Epitope and the stages of the viral cycle it existed in<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112304"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.3849"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. We did a sequence comparison that showed that EDE was conserved across
            serotypes. <b>We finally derived our scFv sequence from the C-10 antibody</b>. 
            <br />
            We looked into acquiring the E dimer epitope and considered obtaining the Envelope protein and dimerising it in the solution. However,
            <b>Dr Milind Gore, a highly-acclaimed immunologist and the former director of the National Institute of Virology (NIV)</b>, made us aware
            of the fact that the Envelope protein only dimerises and folds accurately in the presence of the pRM protein. This is the reason why
            vaccines that use just the E protein tend to fail to elicit neutralizing antibodies against EDE.<br/>
            Due to safety concerns, we could not use the entire virus and instead chose to work with a Dengue VLP whose cassette had been deposited
            by Dr Stephen Harrisson, Harvard, in Addgene. We then had <b>several discussions with Dr Rahul Roy who is a Dengue Virologist at IISc,
            Bangalore</b>, who was strongly supportive of going with the EDE and advised us against using a cocktail of antibodies, since that could
            lessen chances of neutralization. <b>He also offered to let us borrow his Dengue VLP construct and offered his help and lab space</b> to
            work
            on neutralization assays for our proof of concept. <b>Debayani Chakraborty</b>, from his lab, very graciously gave us her time and helped
            us perform our assay<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112304"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtm.2017.03.003"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.

             Once we settled on our project after integrating and evaluating our project based on all the advice we received, we proceeded with
             designing our model and testing it out with our experiments. Our Dry Lab and Wet Lab components are truly entwined throughout our cycle,
             and we received constant support, advice and guidance from several professors and PhD mentors at IISER who were always ready to
             troubleshoot and offer alternative solutions. We also spoke to several experts from across the world to ensure that our project design
             was viable.
           </p>
         </div>
         <div class="content-card">
           <h2>Dry Lab</h2>
           <p>
            Modeling was an important part of our project. Our Dry Lab journey began with trying to find sequences for a full-length IgY. We managed
            to put together the constant region of IgY with the variable region of IgG, with the help extended by <b>Dr David Bradley, and 
            Juho Choi</b> was kind enough to give us the sequence of the constant region.<br/> 
            During this process, we realized that a 3D structure of IgY had never been publicly resolved and so sought to determine the 3D structure
            for our IgY-IgG construct. <b>Dr M.S. Madhusudhan, an Associate Professor at IISER, Pune, working in the field of Bioinformatics and
            Structure</b>, was a great help to us. He guided us through the usage of AlphaFold for structure prediction and was key in helping us
            interpret the results. With his help, we managed to obtain a predicted structure for IgY-IgG. 
     
           </p>
           <p>
             The majority of our dry lab falls under two domains:<br />
             MOLECULAR MODELING: This is an umbrella domain for - 
            </p>
            <ol type = "a">
              <li>AlphaFold structure prediction</li>
              <li>Molecular Docking</li>
              <li>Molecular Dynamics</li>
            </ol>
           <p>
            <b>Dr Madhusudhan</b> helped us extensively in getting started with AlphaFold and in interpreting the results. He helped us with an
             overview of molecular docking and suggested us to set up differential protonation of histidine residues in molecular dynamics simulations
             in testing out the functionality of our NeoFvs in different pH conditions. 
            </p>
            <p>
             <b>Dr Arnab Mukherjee</b>, who is a professor working in the fields of Chemistry, Data Science, Theoretical and computational chemistry
             and biophysics at IISER, Pune, helped us with the different techniques in the molecular dynamics in our screening workflow. 
           </p>
           <h2>Statistical Design of Experiments (DOE):</h2>
           <p>
             We had several meetings with the inventor of SHuffle, Dr Mehmet (Memo) Berkmen, who was incredibly patient and gracious enough to go over
             the nitty-gritties of working with SHuffle and helped us design our plasmid construct for producing IgY-IgG and NeoFvs.<br/> 
             SHuffle bacterial strain was novel to us and largely to iGEM as well, so wanted to optimize the working conditions of SHuffle to 
             produce complex proteins. Memo suggested that we try statistical design of experiments (DOE) to find the optimal working conditions for
             SHuffle. He put us in touch with <b>Dr Thomas Howard, an international expert in DOE and synthetic biology</b>. Dr Howard was very
             helpful in getting us started with the technique, introducing us to the philosophy of DOE and the various softwares used. He also advised
             us to have a BSA calibrated SDS-PAGE as a quantitative estimate of yield of protein as a tool to measure the success of DOE.<br/>
             <b>Dr Mugdha Gadgil, an expert in CHO cells and DOE, currently working at the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune, India</b>, met
             with us multiple times and helped us in adapting our project and factors to the DOE workflow. <b>Rushik Bhatti, a PhD student at IISER,
             Pune</b>, helped us finalise our protocols, list of experiments and factors for DOE. He advised us against using RPM as a factor and told
             us to normalize the OD measurements for all our cultures. <br/>

           <h2>Wet Lab</h2>
           <p>
             Our wet lab work began in early April. Most of us were largely inexperienced with molecular biology, and our PhD mentors played an
             irreplaceable role, guiding us and showing us how to perform each experiment. They were constantly present and ready to help us
             troubleshoot. <b>Dr Mehmet Berkmen</b> was instrumental in getting us started and helped us chart out our early experiments. He helped us
             design our plasmid constructs and even went on to send us both strains of SHuffle E.coli - SHuffle B and SHuffle K-12, plasmids for
             cytoplasmic protein chaperones, proteins and antibodies for ELISA and the cyclonal plasmid from his own work.
           </p>
           <p>
             <b>Dr Rahul Roy</b>, as previously mentioned, had offered us VLPs for a VLP fusion assay and we needed properly folded, purified proteins
             to
             complete the assay. To test the proper functionality of SHuffle with regard to protein folding, we approached several experts. 
           </p>
           <p>
             <b>Dr Sunish Radhakrishnan, who is an Associate Professor at IISER, Pune</b>, cautioned us against trusting an ELISA for proper protein
             folding since an ELISA only requires the binding sequence in the correct conformation. He suggested that we perform a maleimide-PEG assay
             in conjunction with ELISA to determine if the correct disulphide bonds have been formed. We were also looking for an assay to measure
             dissolved oxygen in our culture without using a bioreactor and he suggested that we go for the Clark electrode method. 
     
           </p>
           <p>
             <b>Dr Siddhesh Kamat, an Associate Professor at IISER, Pune</b>, suggested that we perform a Thermal shift assay with SYPRO Orange to
             test for proper protein folding. He suggested that we perform a Thermal shift assay with SYPRO Orange to test for proper protein folding.
            </p>
           <p>
             After folding, we needed to determine the overall strength of binding of our antibody or its avidity and the subsequent neutralization
             capacity. <b>Dr Gayathri Pananghat, Associate Professor at IISER Pune</b>, offered to help us out by making mutations in our antibody
             that would increase its binding affinity. <b>Dr Varadarajan Sundaramurthy, a host-pathogen interaction expert from NCBS, Bangalore</b>,
             suggested that we try phagocytosis as a method for determining the neutralization extent of our antibodies. Since one of our antibodies
             had a peptide linker to increase its half-life, we were recommended an FcRn binding assay by Dr Sundaramurthy to check if our antibody
             could be recycled. <br/>
             <b>Dr Sanjeev Galande, a renowned epigeneticist at SNU, Delhi</b>, helped us out with our wet lab organization and reagents.

           <h1>Devising the Drug Delivery System</h1>
           <p>
             Our literature review<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/abt/tbz002"><sup>[12]</sup></a> suggested three common modes of transport for
             antibody treatments - subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous. While
             subcutaneous, followed by intramuscular, would be best for ease of
             administration and compliance, the primary concerns in making this
             choice are that of safety and efficacy, which must be judged in
             preclinical and clinical trials. During our search for a viable mode of
             drug delivery we received inputs from several experts - <b>Dr Supriya
             Kashikar</b> told us about IgY being made into an oral prophylactic
             treatment for Covid-19 and advised us to do something similar, as it can
             easily be absorbed into the digestive tract.
           </p>
           <p>
             <b>Dr Harsha Patel</b> instead advised us to go for an IV mode of treatment
             since it would be easier to administer in a government hospital set-up
             and would have greater accountability since the patient would have to
             come to the hospital to get treated and wouldn’t be responsible for
             their own treatment. This is especially important in a country like
             India where the majority of those infected by Dengue would be from poor
             economic backgrounds, and likely to be mistrustful and ignorant of
             medicines.<br />
             <b>Dr Vandana Patravale, a drug-delivery expert from ICT, Mumbai and Prof Nishikant Subhedar, a pharmacology expert from IISER, Pune</b>,
             on the other hand,
             advised us to go for an encapsulated mode of delivery and asked us to
             look into sustained release to prolong drug titre in circulation.<br />
             We intend to look into all the possible modes of drug delivery to come
             up with the best possible product.

          <h1>Spreading Awareness</h1>
        
        <p>
          Our conversations with the people around us who made up a major component of our stakeholders, showed that the majority of the people
          were unaware about Dengue or worse had superstitions and flawed perceptions about the disease, doctors and medicine in general. In a bid
          to tackle this problem, we decided to come up with an informative survey that would serve the dual purpose of understanding the
          distribution of awareness about Dengue and dispense information regarding the disease, its pathology, prevention methods and current
          treatment. In order to make our survey more effective, we took the help of <b>Dr Pooja Sancheti, an Assistant Professor in the field of
          Humanities and Social Sciences at IISER, Pune</b>. She asked us to put ourselves in the shoes of our survey takers and analyse the kind
          of questions they would or would not prefer to answer. She suggested that we should ask if our survey taker was from a tropical or
          non-tropical country since that might affect their level of knowledge, which we incorporated into our survey.<br/>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
   
        <p>
         Our project, as it stands now, has consolidated and evaluated all the advice, inputs and suggestions we have received from various 
         stakeholders, our own analysis of the stakeholders’ needs and through prioritising our achievable goals, can be presented as a viable
         solution. We have managed to fulfill most of our requirements of a good therapeutic, of having a good chassis and a target epitope. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        Our therapeutic is a possible cure for a disease with no known cure. It is aimed at being affordable and accessible to everyone,
        especially people from poor economic backgrounds. Additionally, through our project, we are promoting research into Neglected tropical
        Diseases. We have also provided a mechanism for combating Dengue and Dengue like diseases that are caused by viruses having multiple
        virulent serotypes. Through our modular platform, we are also promoting research into production of engineered antibodies and antibody
        therapies. 
  
        </p>
        <p>
          We have several suggestions from leading experts that we plan on
          incorporating into our project in the future. For more details, please
