    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to actively consider how the world affects their work and their work affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your project purpose, design, and execution.</p>
    <p>Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #2 and the Best Integrated Human Practices prize with this page.</p>
    <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/what-is-human-practices">Human Practices Hub</a>.
    <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
              Science and Synthetic Biology has always had a mixed reception from the public, with some viewing it as a brilliant strategy to combat 
              real-world problems and improve human life while others are mistrustful of the threats and dangers it can pose. In order to design a good 
              solution to any problem, one must have a good idea of what those affected by the problem and, therefore, the solution needed. It is 
              important to have <b> a people-centered approach </b> and to actively seek their input at every stage of your project. It is vital to 
              understand their perspective and how your solution should cater to their needs. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Our integrated Human Practices is a story of our journey through <b> understanding and identifying the problem </b>, coming up with a 
              <b> suitable solution </b>, and continuously <b>modifying our solution based on the inputs we have received</b>, ensuring that our 
              project can move <b>beyond being just a laboratory concept</b> into a real-world therapeutic. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="content-card">
            <h1>Highlights</h1>
            <p>A summary of our main findings and how they influenced our project:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
              We researched extensively about <b>Dengue in the news, from papers, on the World Health Organisation site, and from our friends, families,
              academicians, and virologists</b>. We obtained a thorough understanding of the problem in terms of the disease pathology and how it can
              be stopped effectively. We spoke with the <b>local municipal bodies</b> in India - PMC and BBMP, to obtain a case-wise distribution and
              breakup in terms of age, gender, areas prone. We also spoke to a <b>Dengue virologist</b> who routinely interacts and is actively
              involved in spreading awareness about dengue, <b>Dr Maulori Curio Cabral, from Brazil</b> to get a deeper understanding of the situation
              in a different country and social context than ours. 
              </li>
              <li>
               We learned that <b>Dengue has no true cure</b>, and interactions with <b>several doctors</b> in the field made us aware that the current
               treatment for Dengue is aimed at <b>symptom control</b> which is sufficient for a primary infection. However, most primary infections
               are undiagnosed which could lead to a <b>worse secondary infection</b> masquerading as a primary infection. Therefore, our therapeutic
               needs to be equally effective against both primary as well as secondary infections. 
      
              </li>
              <li>
               Our initial project idea involved the production of IgY-IgG hybrid antibodies to target the NS1 antigen. However, <b>based on inputs
               received from several experts</b>, as outlined below, we <b>modified our project</b> to now be the production of scFvs with an
               engineered FcRn binding peptide to increase half-life to target the E dimer Epitope.
              </li>
              <li>
                We sought to <b>quantify the public awareness of Dengue</b> through an informative survey. The point of the survey was to gauge the
                general knowledge about Dengue and simultaneously help spread awareness. 
      
              </li>
              <li>
               Since our project involved working with the Dengue virus, which is a <b>risk group 2 organism</b> and our epitopes contribute toward
               increasing the virulence of the organism, we looked into alternatives for conducting our assay and decided on using VLPs based on the
               suggestion of Dr Rahul Roy.
      
              </li>
              <li>
               We also conducted a webinar in collaboration with MIT_MAHE on <b>Biosafety and Ethics</b> and interacted with the speaker <b>Dr Vinod
               Jyothikumar</b>, regarding the possible safety concerns our project could have and alternative production methods.
              </li>
              <li>
               We spoke to <b>several people from varying socio-economic backgrounds</b> and sought to learn how dengue has affected them and to spread
               awareness about vector control measures.  
      
              </li>

                <p>
                  WHY:<br/>
                  We’ve had several bi-monthly meetings with our PI throughout our iGEM cycle and have constantly updated him regarding our progress.

                <p>
                  WHY:<br/>
                  We wanted to gain insight into the current treatment methods for Dengue from a first-hand source and to see if an alternative therapeutic was necessary.
                </p>
                <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>She told us that the primary treatment was a combination of fluids and was aimed at symptom control.</li>
                  <li>She did not feel that it was necessary for an alternative therapeutic for a primary treatment. However, she said that most primary infections are undiagnosed which could inadvertently lead to a worse secondary infection and so our therapy must be aimed at treating a secondary infection. </li>
                  <li>She asked us to look into the vector control measures undertaken by the Singaporean Government in keeping Dengue under control.</li>
                  <li>She also told us that most Dengue infections during the covid pandemic went undiagnosed due to being accidentally mistaken for a Covid infection.</li>

                    WHY:<br/>
                    We approached them regarding acquiring the sequence of the constant region of IgY.

                  <ul>
                    <li>They were incredibly kind in giving us the sequences of the constant heavy and light chains of a chicken IgY. </li>
                    <li>They also went on to explain to us that the sequence he had sent did not consist of a leader sequence and that a leader sequence which is also known as a signal peptide sequence starting with MET should be added if we wished to express and secrete our antibody in the bacterial system. </li>
                    <li>They added that any antibody sequence to be expressed in a vector should have a Leader sequence - Variable light or heavy chain sequence - Constant light or heavy chain sequence.</li>
                    <li>They told us that, in theory, we could add the sequence of any variable chain before the constant chain and express it, thereby making the construct modular. </li>

                  <p>
                    WHY:<br/>
                    We initially approached him to learn of the possible immune response of our body toward an avian antibody. Since then we have approached him several times to seek his input regarding scFvs, their clearance from the body, possible ways to reduce immunogenicity and therapeutic delivery methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Prof Rath warned us against a possible immune response and said that we would have to be very careful in that aspect since our dosage might also have to vary depending on the disease progression which could lead to toxicity.</li>
                    <li>He advised against deimmunisation via T-cell epitope mapping and mutations since it might destabilize the antibody and compromise functionality. </li>
                    <li>He told us that we were coming up with a much more expensive production method for IgYs than what already existed and cautioned us against going ahead with it since the cons outweighed the pros.</li>
                    <li>He allayed our fears about lacking a possible clearance mechanism and told us that the body’s natural processes of pinocytosis, proteases and lysis should be enough.  </li>
                    <li>He told us that there was no concrete evidence that the FcRn receptor is solely responsible for increasing the half-life, and that it may as well be that size plays an equally important role. He asked us to conduct a four-fold assay with scFv + FcRnBp, scFv dimers + FcRnBp, scFv dimers and scFv to analyse this. We were very interested in knowing how this assay pans out but were unable to run it owing to time constraints.</li>

                    WHY:<br/>
                    We approached herinitially to learn more about the immune system and the possible immune reaction against avian antibodies and later to update her regarding our project and gain her inputs.

                  <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>She cautioned us about using IgY as a mode of treatment since it could cause a possibly fatal immunogenic reaction in the body. </li>
                    <li>She also told us not to worry too much about our project and that it did sound viable with the kind of assays we had planned. </li>
                    <li>She asked us to look into epitopes involved with membrane fusion since those were usually structural proteins and easier to target.</li>
                    <li>TShe advised against an antibody cocktail targeting more than one serotype since it would bring down the titre value of the useful antibodies. </li>
                    <li>She also imparted much needed advice on how to look for the correct literature, which sources to trust and how best to conduct a literature review. </li>
                    <li>She also told us that we should not be looking at the relative affinity of IgY and IgG to dengue and instead be looking at the off-rate of IgG and the on-rate of IgY since we are not trying to outcompete but to displace.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>She suggested, and we accepted after a literature review, to opt for the E dimer Epitope which exists in the pre-mature to mature stage of the virus. Since the breathability of this dimer structure to form a trimer and allow the Fusion loop to establish contact with the host cell is crucial for viral entry, hindering this would aid in decreasing the viral load in the body. </li>
                    <li>She also suggested that we choose the C-10 class of antibodies which had been isolated from humans that targetted the EDE. </li>
                    <li>She told us that the envelope protein could be induced to dimerize in the solution. </li>
                    <li>She advised against using Anti-NS1 antibodies since it requires a certain threshold viral load to produce NS1 proteins. </li>
                    <li>She also told us that Anti-NS1 antibodies are found to destroy epithelial cells, which could contribute to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, and that they cross-react with host proteins.
                        She advised against going for the fusion loop epitope, which was our then plan since apparently exposure of the epitope varies according to the serotype.
                        She told us that dosage calculations have to be experimental and that any model or formula could lead to over or under estimations.

                    <li>He asked us to reach out to Foundations that help with Dengue. He wanted us to talk to more industrialists and vaccine producers. He was quite satisfied with our progress in the cycle and offered small tips on coming up with a good pitch and presentation. 
                        He asked us to talk to the district magistrate office since they would have information on the distribution of Dengue Cases.

                   WHO:<br/>
                   Prof. Milind M. Gore worked on various levels at the National Institute of Virology Pune from 1978 to 2017 after his initial Ph.D. studies. He is currently a retired Scientist G (Director level) from NIV. He has extensive experience and expertise in Immunology including clinical situations and animal models.

                  <p>
                    WHY:<br/>
                    We sought the expertise of Dr Gore and wanted his insights into improving our project. At the time, we were trying to decide between Aglycosylated IgGs and NeoFvs.

                  <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Dr Gore was of the opinion that scFvs might be a viable option over a full-length IgG as long as the half-lives were comparable.</li>
                    <li>He agreed that EDE was a great option to target and wanted to know our plans of obtaining it. When he heard that we planned on inducing dimerisation of Envelope protein in solution, he disagreed with us and said that the E protein tends to not dimerise or fold properly in the absence of the pRM protein. 
                    He suggested that we modify the design for a MAC-ELISA protocol for testing the functionality of our NeoFvs.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WHY:<br/>
                    Following Dr Gore’s suggestions and our own readings, we decided upon working with scFvs with an engineered binding peptide to increase half-life and we had several questions regarding the functionality of these modified scFvs. To have some of these questions answered, we reached out to Dr Sirk who is the person that helped engineer these binding peptides onto scFvs for breast cancer.

                  <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>She said that the orientation of the scFvs either in VL-VH or VH-VL does not matter since most scFvs work in both directions. However, she did say that they experienced certain problems with expression and binding to FcRn in certain variants which might have been solved by using the reverse orientation (they had used the VL-VH orientation.
                        She told us that their engineered fragments are predicted to persist for several days, and hopefully weeks.
                    </li>
                    <li>She also told us that these binding peptides did not seem to be interfering with the antigen binding affinity and that the case was the same for all variants including unmodified fragments which came as a relief for us. 
                        She also asked us to reach out to Mr Vince Kelly, who was the primary author on the paper.

                  <p>
                    WHY:<br/>
                    We reached out to him upon the suggestion of Dr Sirk to clarify some further questions that we had about scFvs + FcRn Bp.
                  <p>TAKEAWAY: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>He informed us that in their study not all variants (including N terminal peptides) could be generated due to time and resource constraints (we surpassed that by using haddock correctly)
                        He advised us against expressing and purifying our own FcRn is very difficult, try to do it on cell lines
                    </li>
                    <li>He told us that the orientation (VH-VL or VL-VH) probably doesn't matter too much in agreement with Dr Sirk.He added that the double peptide variant was to mimic the homodimeric nature of IgG
                        We wanted to know if the cyclic or linearised version of the peptide was better to which he said that the cyclic mutation plays a structural stability role
                    </li>
                    <li>He also said that the Y12H mutation plays a role in enhanced pH dependent binding due to histidine being more active at low pH in the endosome and was essential for proper functionality. 
                        He proposed that one of the directions to take this forward is to engineer bacteria and release them into the gut such that they produce these scfv-fcrnbps when needed.
                        He was happy with our project taking the initially engineered fragment beyond cancer into Dengue therapeutics.

                   WHO:<br/>
                   We visited a vasti near our campus to gain their perspective on Dengue. A vasti is the local term for a slum-like area consisting of people living in very poor conditions. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WHY:<br/>
                    People living in slums, in closed and cramped quarters in poor living conditions are the most hard-hit demographic by Dengue. It is crucial to understand the extent of the problem and how best to cater to their needs.

                  <p>
                    When we first walked into their vasti which was just off the main road, we saw that the entire place was filled with water from the recent rains. In fact a few days back some of our team members saw that the heavy rains had forced most of the people away from the settlement due water logging. We saw people standing on the road with their belongings on their heads, which prompted us to visit to learn more. 
    We learnt that during every rainy season, their surroundings turn into swamps from where begins the uncontrollable problem of mosquitoes and other insects. We learnt that their toilets get flooded and their water supply gets contaminated. We also learnt of their reluctance to go to a clinic and seek medical help despite serious illnesses. Our conversations led us to the conclusion that the majority of our consumers would be ignorant, from low economic backgrounds, reluctant to seek medical attention and get tested. Therefore, our solution and efforts needed to cater to all these points. <br/><br/>

                        She asked us how our outreach and efforts at educating the public be any different than reading something in the news, and stressed the importance of having a good approach.
                    </li>
                    <li>She also advised us to talk to the adults, in most demographics, about spreading efforts and education so that they can go ahead and educate their children. 
                        With reference to our survey, she said the simpler and easier it is to understand the better reception we would get. She also wanted us to gauge the variation of awareness amongst those from a tropical country vs those from non-tropical countries. We made edits to our survey based on her suggestions.

                        He approved of our choice of epitope and said that quaternary epitopes are the best. 
                        He went on to tell us that he had just recently finished writing a paper on the distribution of Dengue serotypes in India.
                    </li>
                    <li>He suggested that we use a Dengue VLP when we were looking for an alternative to a whole virus to express our protein and very kindly offered to give us the plasmid. He went on to offer to produce the VLPs himself and help us run our assays at his institute. Debayani Chakraborty, from his lab, gave us her time and helped us perform a successful assay. 
                        For proof of concept, he suggested that we do a Fusion-quenching assay to check the neutralization of the virus. He also offered to perform the same at his institute.

It is one of the most prevalent bacteria involved in spreading the Vibriosis disease in fish. Our approach involves targeting Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7—i.e., MAM7—an adhesion protein which helps the bacteria to hold onto the host cells.

                   The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Pune Municipal Corporation are local governing bodies in Bangalore and Pune respectively. We spoke to Dr Madhusudan and Shri. Sanjiv Vavare from the two bodies. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WHY:<br/>
                    We wished to understand the case-wise distribution of Dengue in areas close to us and know of the measures undertaken by the governments to prevent the spread of dengue. Knowing the patterns of spread and the measures already undertaken would help us understand the scope of our project better and fill the gaps in communication with our outreach. 
                  </p>
                  <p>At the PMC, we met Shri. Sanjeev Wavare from the Health Department. He spoke of the general trend seen in Pune over the years and said that due to the intermittent rains that cause an increase in stagnant water-filled years which in turn see a rise in the incidences of Dengue during the months of July-October. He was of the opinion that during covid, the number of cases went down since people weren’t in closed spaces as much and added that it could also be due to Aedes primarily being a day-biter. He also made it a point to mention that the prevention of the spread of Dengue is entirely dependent on public participation and that their main control measures were holding rallies, society meetings for vector control, demonstrations and distributing pamphlets.  
                    July and October tend to have the most Dengue cases. He mentioned that 2014 saw the highest no. of cases due to intermittent rains. This caused a lot of transfusion shortage. He mentioned that around 70 percent of the cases were Normal Dengue cases, 20 percent had Dengue Haemorrhagic fever while 10 percent got Dengue Shock syndrome. 
                    We also asked Dr Wavare about the measures taken after people are diagnosed with Dengue. Fogging and spraying is done immediately by PMC workers at locations where the cases were diagnosed. He also mentioned chemical control using chemicals like Temephos, VTI liquid, larvicides, and dichlorobenzene. 
                    At the BBMP, we met Dr Madhusudan from the Health Department. He gave us extensive data on the ward-wise cases of dengue in the last few years and commented on the decrease in cases seen over the last couple of years and agreed that it might be due to the pandemic.

                <div>
                  <p>
                   WHO:<br/>
                   Santosh Kadam is 34 years old and has been working as a helper at our institute for 10 years. He has only been educated till 8th grade but has picked up skills of operating the autoclave and protocols of decontamination and discard of waste biological materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WHY:<br/>
                    These workers are typically from marginalized communities from rural areas. He counts as an important stakeholder in our quest for a therapeutic for Dengue. 
                  </p>
                  <p>TAKEAWAY: <br/>
                    He talked about another neglected disease prevalent in his hometown of Nanded, in Hingoli district of our state of Maharashtra - Chikungunya. He spoke about his observations of people having extreme joint pain that they couldn’t walk or stand.
    He talked at length about the low levels of medical care in the village, and their dependence on homemade remedies. Sometimes visiting doctors would come to his village and administer shots, but there weren’t any established well-educated doctors in residence there.
    When we asked him about how a therapeutic for Dengue fever could be received in his community, he brought about the point of awareness. He drew parallels with the low COVID vaccination rates in his village and erroneous beliefs like how COVID would vanish because of the high heat in the summer. We felt this was a point we overlooked. Once our drug eventually comes to market, it should be received well, given it works. 
    We also had other discussions about the relevance of scientific research for the common man in India, about the education system in India and how it differs in urban and rural areas. He also said that he is employed because students like us work at the institute. If we don’t study – people like him don’t have a job.
