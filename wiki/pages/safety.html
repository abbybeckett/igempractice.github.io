                  <p>Our work primarily involved the use of fluorophore-attached DNA oligos for the detection of biomarkers. This did not pose any specific safety concerns, apart from the general lab safety measures. We have to procure the biomarkers from a reliable company. We have experiments involving the use of E. coli DH5 alpha and BL21 DE3 for the cloning and expression of Gs alpha protein. Both of these belong to risk group 1. The use of nanoparticles in our experiments needed the use of masks when working with them. Experiments like Native page, TEM, gel electrophoresis etc. involve the use of specific laboratory equipments that has to be dealt with carefully. All the chemicals have to be handled with proper care. The material used for chip-making has to be chosen to minimize the effect on the environment. Proper waste disposal measures have to be taken. The tool we designed is to be tested on blood, but this would pose a lot of safety issues from blood-borne pathogens and contaminants.

                  <h4><b>Risks</b></h4>
                  <p>With our plan to have a discardable chip, it was important for us to ensure the safety of our environment, the materials used for the chip has to have minimal effect on the environment. To ensure the safety of our users and to bring down the price of our kit for the benefit of society, minimising or avoiding the use of enzymes were better. The detection unit of our tool is designed to be a permanent hardware of multiple use, and therefore the material has to be chosen carefully so that it is durable, but also aids in the eventual disposal of the hardware.</p>
                  <h4><b>Actions</b></h4>
                  <p>The DNA oligos was purchased from idt and the biomarkers were purchased from Merck. All our team members have received safety training prior to working in lab. This included the training for handling basic laboratory equipments and emergency measures. The workspace was wiped with 70 percent ethanol, before and after work. All experiments involving Ecoli was done in the biocabinet and the cabinet was sterilized with UV  before and after use. Use of instruments like TEM, and plate reader was only done in the presence of a phd.In native page, we used SYBR Safe instead of Ethidium bromide as it is less mutagenic.Proper training of waste disposal on the basis of colour of bin was given to the members by the lab technician. The waste disposal system is managed by Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly (IMAGE). While running experiments involving circuits for fluorescence detector, proper care was taken to ensured that all circuits were correctly made before connecting to power output. We have decided to avoid the use of blood for our experiments, minimising the risk of any potential exposure to pathogens present in blood. </p>

                  <h4><b>Risks</b></h4>
                  <p>Proper precautions to be taken for conducting experiments. Permission for conducting activities in different locations has to be taken. Surveys should be conducted after obtaining proper consent. We also wanted to make sure that the the waste from experiments conducted in schools were segregated and discarded properly, ensuring safety of students, environment and fostering safe lab conducts among students.</p>
                  <h4><b>Actions</b></h4>
                  <p>When conducting activities on public places, permissions from nearby legal authorities were acquired. All the surveys had a consent form to be signed before filling the survey. This form also had the details od the data being collected and how it will be used. All the experiments as part on outreach in schools were done using common chemicals that are found in everyday items and was not harmful to humans. The waste from these experiments were collected and disposed of separately. </p>
                  <h4><b>Ethical concerns</b></h4>
                  <p>Eliminating the use of blood in our research helped to alleviate the concerns related to procuring samples and handling of blood. All the data collected from surveys had a consent form, and the data collected has not been used for any other purpose. We have planned a structure on how data can be collected from our chip with the user's permission into a database while ensuring their privacy. “Link PI” </p>
