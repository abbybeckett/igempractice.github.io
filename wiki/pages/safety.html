                  <p>With our plan to have a discardable chip, it was important for us to ensure the safety of our environment, the materials used for the chip has to have minimal effect on the environment. To ensure the safety of our users and to bring down the price of our kit for the benefit of society, minimising or avoiding the use of enzymes were better. The detection unit of our tool is designed to be a permanent hardware of multiple use, and therefore the material has to be chosen carefully so that it is durable, but also aids in the eventual disposal of the hardware.</p>

                  <p>Our work primarily involved the use of fluorophore-attached DNA oligos for the detection of biomarkers. This did not pose any specific safety concerns, apart from the general lab safety measures. We have to procure the biomarkers from a reliable company. We have experiments involving the use of E. coli DH5 alpha and BL21 DE3 for the cloning and expression of Gs alpha protein. Both of these belong to risk group 1. The use of nanoparticles in our experiments needed the use of masks when working with them. Experiments like Native page, TEM, gel electrophoresis etc. involve the use of specific laboratory equipments that has to be dealt with carefully. All the chemicals have to be handled with proper care. The material used for chip-making has to be chosen to minimize the effect on the environment. Proper waste disposal measures have to be taken. The tool we designed is to be tested on blood, but this would pose a lot of safety issues from blood-borne pathogens and contaminants.

    <h2>Safe Project Design</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis</li>
      <li>Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants</li>
      <li>Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment</li>
      <li>Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device</li>
    </ul>
