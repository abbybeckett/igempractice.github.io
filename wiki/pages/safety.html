                  <p>Our work primarily involved the use of fluorophore-attached DNA oligos for the detection of biomarkers. This did not pose any specific safety concerns, apart from the general lab safety measures. We have to procure the biomarkers from a reliable company. We have experiments involving the use of E. coli DH5 alpha and BL21 DE3 for the cloning and expression of Gs alpha protein. Both of these belong to risk group 1. The use of nanoparticles in our experiments needed the use of masks when working with them. Experiments like Native page, TEM, gel electrophoresis etc. involve the use of specific laboratory equipments that has to be dealt with carefully. All the chemicals have to be handled with proper care. The material used for chip-making has to be chosen to minimize the effect on the environment. Proper waste disposal measures have to be taken. The tool we designed is to be tested on blood, but this would pose a lot of safety issues from blood-borne pathogens and contaminants.

This included the training for handling basic laboratory equipments and emergency measures. The workspace was wiped with 70 percent ethanol, before and after work. All experiments involving Ecoli was done in the biocabinet and the cabinet was sterilized with UV  before and after use. Use of instruments like TEM, and plate reader was only done in the presence of a phd.In native page, we used SYBR Safe instead of Ethidium bromide as it is less mutagenic.Proper training of waste disposal on the basis of colour of bin was given to the members by the lab technician. The waste disposal system is managed by Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly (IMAGE). While running experiments involving circuits for fluorescence detector, proper care was taken to ensured that all circuits were correctly made before connecting to power output. We have decided to avoid the use of blood for our experiments, minimising the risk of any potential exposure to pathogens present in blood. </p>

            Existing blood-biomarker-based kits rely on a single biomarker,
            which is non-specific, unreliable and inconclusive for a 
            heterogeneous disorder like MDD. To tackle this, we decided to 
            use five different biomarkers - one neurotransmitter, two miRNAs,
            one hormone, and one protein.<sup><a href = "#ref21">[21]</a></sup>

            We will integrate our quantification assays into a microfluidic 
            chip for fast, readable results. The quantifiers emit a fluorescent 
            signal upon binding to the target biomarkers, which fluorimetric 
            sensors will detect and analyse. Microfluidic chips can be designed 
            to be compact, cost-effective, and can be sensitised to give more 
            conclusive test results.<sup><a href = "#ref22">[22]</a></sup>

              The design involves five channels, one for each biomarker. The blood sample is introduced to the main port, 
              which is equally divided into all the channels through valves and pumps. 
              Each channel has different chambers, called mixers, that contain the quantifiers:
              magnetic nanoprobes for miRNAs and FRET aptamers for serotonin, cortisol, and Gsα. 
              These mixers are chosen based on the specific conditions required for the quantifier 
              to attach to the biomarkers. Once the quantifiers bind to the biomarkers, 
              we flow them into transparent chambers where fluorimetric sensors can sense 
              the fluorescence and give us a measurement of the biomarkers.<sup><a href = "#ref33">[33]</a></sup>

            Although the iGEM competition cycle concludes in November 2023, 
            continued innovation using synthetic biology is the true vision 
            of iGEM and is a continuous endeavour. We would like to share our 
            results with the broader scientific community. Going through the 
            peer-review process and obtaining expert feedback will help us 
            improve our experiment choice, data interpretation and presentation. 
            We want to demonstrate a more robust and complete proof of concept of our idea. 
            We plan to explore and incorporate more biomarkers into the kit to increase the 
            test's sensitivity. We will also update our protocol with pioneering changes in 
            measurement and quantification to help make the kit as affordable as possible.

            remind them to take medication and keep up with regular appointments with a doctor.
