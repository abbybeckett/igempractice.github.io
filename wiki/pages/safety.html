                  <p>Our work primarily involved the use of fluorophore-attached DNA oligos for the detection of biomarkers. This did not pose any specific safety concerns, apart from the general lab safety measures. We have to procure the biomarkers from a reliable company. We have experiments involving the use of E. coli DH5 alpha and BL21 DE3 for the cloning and expression of Gs alpha protein. Both of these belong to risk group 1. The use of nanoparticles in our experiments needed the use of masks when working with them. Experiments like Native page, TEM, gel electrophoresis etc. involve the use of specific laboratory equipments that has to be dealt with carefully. All the chemicals have to be handled with proper care. The material used for chip-making has to be chosen to minimize the effect on the environment. Proper waste disposal measures have to be taken. The tool we designed is to be tested on blood, but this would pose a lot of safety issues from blood-borne pathogens and contaminants.

                  <p>The DNA oligos was purchased from idt and the biomarkers were purchased from Merck. All our team members have received safety training prior to working in lab. This included the training for handling basic laboratory equipments and emergency measures. The workspace was wiped with 70 percent ethanol, before and after work. All experiments involving Ecoli was done in the biocabinet and the cabinet was sterilized with UV  before and after use. Use of instruments like TEM, and plate reader was only done in the presence of a phd.In native page, we used SYBR Safe instead of Ethidium bromide as it is less mutagenic.Proper training of waste disposal on the basis of colour of bin was given to the members by the lab technician. The waste disposal system is managed by Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly (IMAGE). While running experiments involving circuits for fluorescence detector, proper care was taken to ensured that all circuits were correctly made before connecting to power output. We have decided to avoid the use of blood for our experiments, minimising the risk of any potential exposure to pathogens present in blood. </p>

          Welcome to the safety page of iGEM IISER TVM. 
          Project OASYS aims to make a blood biomarker-based microfluidic device that can aid in the diagnosis of clinical depression. 
          Like Uncle Ben wisely said <b>“With great power comes great responsibility”</b>, our team has given utmost priority to ensuring a safe workplace and product design.
          You can find the details of all the safety and ethical aspects that have been considered in our project design here.
